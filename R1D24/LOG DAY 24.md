**LOG R1D24** (07/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1214427697310507009)

**what i did:**
- i rewrote my whole js file from scratch, calmly, with a sort of "idea of the structure".

**what i learned:**
- so many things! i put them in the comments of the js code.
- my way isn't actually the ideal way to make a game lol!!! 
there is a much more efficient/classy manner, taught by freecodecamp in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0&t=571s)
but i just can't do that now because it would mean coding along the mentor and not understand anything *by myself/for myself*
so i scaled his teachings down to what i needed to know for now, like i translate it for me and try it alone on my own until i get it! 
takes much longer but much more beneficial on the long run for sure! as it gives me a PERSONAL knowledge of JS (but best advices are to respect immediately and messy/inaccurate information to discard.)
- GAME DEV is fantastic. i think i will get to it later, when i'm knowledge-ready. 1 month = 30 days... ;)
(gameloop (what is it?), this., constructor (sounds great, what is it??) ETC.... + to have several js files, import/export etc..)

**next step:**
- find/write my correct moveLeft and moveRight functions to make this paddle MOVE!
