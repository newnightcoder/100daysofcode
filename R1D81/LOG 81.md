**LOG R1D81** (04/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1235115165437153281) 

**what i did:**

- i started to use NOTION!!! absolutely mindblowing, everything is possible/perfect UX lol => i started my TECHNICAL personal blog!!! this is PERFECT. 
i've wanted to do that for a long time, since reading [this article](https://medium.com/better-programming/5-reasons-why-you-should-write-technical-blog-posts-as-developer-30cd349ece60) by devbyrayray.
i am extremely happy, it will help solidify my knowledge / archive my learning process + i really like the look/design/functionalities!

- i could write my first **fetch()** request to get my token from Amadeus, in order to make my API call!!!
- i found the full syntax/parameters for MY request on my own, great feeling of better understanding how JS works from a syntaxic+logic point of view.
- i got error messages from the console (cf wrong syntax and then finally: CORS BLOCK!!! very happy!!!)

**what i learned:**

A LOT!!!
- i started to dive into/learn: HTTP REQUESTS / CORS / cURL (Mike formation API!)
- i finally learned about the fetch() method! intense! (thanks to Laszlo, Jon + extensive explanation by Chris // MDN + Steve Griffith)
- i feel better and better with JS / but feel the learning curve here 
- that's awesome to code for that!!! very exciting!


**next:**

- fix the CORS error (local host/server issue? or 'content-type' parameters?), get the token and make the API CALL.
- NOTION: update technical blog + continue archiving of all resources until up to date!
