[Jacob](https://twitter.com/GridMage) did this little [trailer video](https://twitter.com/GridMage/status/1232575228816936963) of Arkanoid mini and it is amazing. magic.

**what i did:**

- i released Arkanoid mini yesterday evening/night, after pushing it to a github page. happy because everything has been successfully implemented in the game or solutions/ideas found, to finish/release the GAME.
- i fixed the font problem that happened during the first 4 hours lol, it was horrible: 404 for arkanoid.ttf... finally fixed! easiest/shortest path = the best. (+ think about relative/absolute paths)
- my 1st JS project is finished!

GAME RELEASE:

- cool to push oneself to the max to deliver.
- relief now + exhaustion but feel super happy and hyper because the game has turned out somehow better than i even thought it would when i started! so i just had fun and went full-on to what i wanted, cool! + AGILE principles hahahaha
- github pages is cool actually! i panicked and hated it but it's actually an absolutely great platform to share one's work. 
- i love game development, a lot is possible through it!! and technically that's extremely exciting as well. intellectually challenging and brilliant! it would be fantastic to get one day to that level of dexterity!!! 
- i learned a lot through this process, the need for new tools (chrome debugger tools more and more, i understand etc...) and comprehension of other things (GET, request, errors etc...) increase as i go along and grow in knowledge/PRACTICE.
- it opens now a new boulevard of perspectives learning-wise! i'm happy!

**next**

- rest by watching a course on APIs/CRUD or something else, but something fundamental + to level up in knowledge. 
- rest by doing a more simple project if possible. else go full on again but be sure. it's draining. do a small project, that's better. balance is important too. we'll see.
- more gamedev!!!! fantastic thing. wow.
