*i am finally back from my first BURNOUT ever! ([tweet here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1270385159683145729)).
i was down for a bit more than 2 weeks, couldn't get to code, felt exhausted, out of order so to speak!
it made me realize that i have to be less of a perfectionnist and put less pressure on myself regarding my own coding skills and twitter presence.
the most important is to get to code everyday and keep the pace. the best is to do small projects and use what i learn for bigger projects, step by step.
my covid dashboard was good, i did a nice job with the API etc.. but i hit a wall when i tried to implement a functionality i couldn't get to work, though i received great help...so i'll get back to it later. 
for now, i need to start a new project and refresh my coding skills!!
i feel energized and happy thanks to all the support i received and i'm ready to get back to it!
as someone said: it's a MARATHON, not a SPRINT! so let's go!* 


**what i did:**

- i started a TO-DO app = CRUD!!!
- i did the overall CSS design
- implemented dynamic date with JS/moment.js

**what i learned**

- i didn't lose my little coding skills! it's been a pleasure to get back to code.

**next:**

- implement CRUD functionalities.
