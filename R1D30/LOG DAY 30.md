**LOG R1D30** (13/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1216608245231575045)

**what i did:**

- i finally coded for the paddle to move with arrowkeys!!! 

**what i learned:**

A LOT!
- event keydown is not enough!!! i needed to think about KEYUP for the eventListener!!! else it's not playable! 
when creating keyboard control: always keydown +  KEYUP!
- if/else if statements 
- learned what arrow functions are and i do NOT need that for the moment.
- i finally completely understand the LOOP thing in a game: the name LOOP made me make a fatal logic error this whole time!! actually I DONT CARE about a LOOP function with the name "loop"! 
i decided to create my own GAME FUINCTION, which is a LOOP because i decide it: requestAnimationFrame(game) calls the game function again and so on).
i understand the loop mechanism!
- for now i have not created any "update" function per say, i just use my game function (looped) with: requestAnimationFrame(game) + invocation of the draw and move functions!
- once again: THANK YOU CONSOLE. it made me fix EVERYTHING!!!

- it will take more time for me to finish this game. i wanted to deliver the whole thing within 10 days and it's been 8 days already for the paddle alone!
- it is so true that things that i couldn't understand last week are soooo crystal clear/easy today!
- i have to be patient and keep working/learning and not be so scared when i don't understand, it will come, do not worry.

**next step:**

- erase everything and rewrite the code from scratch!! yeah!!
- the ball.
