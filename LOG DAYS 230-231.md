**what i did:**

- i could implement the MORE button in worldwide stats section (component toggle)!! did it without help but it took a while because i got mixed up with the data
- tried to take time THINKING the UI in advance in order to give it a direction. it slowly takes shape in my head. have to hurry up.

**what i learned:**

- more practice of state management both in class component and with useState, i'm really getting used to it, even if sometimes it takes time for me to find the missing part, i fully understand the principle/how it works!!!
- useState with boolean is really easy! (cf darkmode of the todo app etc...)

**next:**

- the GLOBE
- the SEARCH filter!! or SELECT ? = interactivity with the list of countries!!
- REFACTOR THE CODE / OPTIMIZE STYLED COMPONENTS (cf Counters.jsx and More.jsx)
- ~countries component!!! list or table~
