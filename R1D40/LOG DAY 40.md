**LOG R1D40** (23/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1220230129294757890)

**what i did:**

- after suddenly UNDERSTANDING that the rows and columns of bricks form a...TABLE! i researched/learned HOW to create a table with JS!!!
- i did a sketch to visualize the bricks as a table and find the connection with their index [r c].

**what i learned:**

- a TABLE can be done thanks to NESTED for loops: a for loop creating the columns is nested in the for loop creating the rows!!!
- it has taken some time for me today to understand all this! i had to confront different sources of learning.
- i should always make a sketch before starting coding for a "complicated" feature. i've already known that since CSS grid but sketching/planning beforehand ON PAPER definitely helps a lot. 

**next step:**
 
 - define proper arrays! which one is what (bricks? rows? columns?) 
 - use nested for loops to create/draw the bricks (use the INDEX OF THE BRICKS in the table, it has to play a role)
