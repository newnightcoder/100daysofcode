**what i did:**

- i played with my drawing function and tried to "investigate".
- i found out around 5am that the problem came from the clearRect() method i used in the drawPaddle function!

**what i learned:**

- where to put the clearRect() in order for bothe elements ball and paddle to coexist.
- i can debug easy things on my own if i do not enter into stress mode. this is a good thing. i am happy!

**next step:**

- animate the ball + collisions everywhere/interaction BALL-PADDLE!!!
