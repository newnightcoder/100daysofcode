**WHERE AM I ON THE ROAD TO BECOME A FRONT-END DEV? (PRE-REACT EVALUATION)**

* **JS :**

    * basic/intermediate syntax (some ES6 included, like: use of const instead of let all the time, arrow functions, template literals, classes/objects + i'm aware of destructuring but never used it sofar)
    * array methods (higher order functions)
    * API call/fetch() method
    * DOM manipulations
    * localStorage
    * geolocation in navigator
    * i'm starting to learn/understand how JS runs under the hood (i'm still at level 1 lol, but i start to get it and that's so interesting to learn!!!)
    * i feel ready to start learning REACT!!! let's go.

* **GIT/GITHUB :**

    * i'm using *Github Desktop* all the time and that has to change NOW (CLI from now on!!!)
    * other than that, i feel comfortable on the platform but still have to dive in more. i know i'm not using it to its full potential...

* **CLI :**

    * very basic commands (pwd, ls, mkdir, touch)
    * for github: git init of course, but i have to do all the rest manually now (i remember some of what i learned during Round 1 but never really applied it on a daily)
    * i know how to run npm/install modules/tools

* **TOOLS :**

    * SASS (Sass allows much more than nesting and mixins but that's the part i use all the time - i could/should get more into it but that's really okay for now)
    * i know how to install/use libraries like moment.js, charts.js, d3.js etc...
    * ESLINT : i'm using it all the time now. (also: it taught me how to configure via the package.json + eslintrc.json files)
    * i should install prettier as well, but happy sofar with eslint/atom beautify


* **PROGRESS TO BE MADE ASAP!**

    * a lot of JS!!! but it will come i'm confident for that. (but i still have so much to cover for real, from destructuring to nice beautiful OOP etc...)
    * use of **CLI** !!! ALL THE TIME - especially for github
    * git/github : 
         * **commit everything on github with CLI only** - really use and explore it. = no more github desktop (except for the 100DaysOfCode repo? we'll see lol)
         * try to spend more time on github in general... 


**GOALS FOR ROUND 3:**

* Learn React
* Follow/finish the courses (Dev Theory's Deep Understanding + Colt Steele's JS course + my usual go-to youtubers)
* Learn how to connect a database
* Try beginner stuff with node.js too!!!
* Learn/practice algoryhm exercises 
* Start working on the portfolio!
* Try and make a blog.


**COMMITMENTS FOR ROUND 3:**

* code EACH DAY monday to friday (get back to rythm of Round 1!!!)
* during weekends: write 1 article about something + publish it / have fun with the starfield or any other little project / or just rest/have fun (but the article writing is MANDATORY in any case).
