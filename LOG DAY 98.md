**LOG R1D98** (21/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1241340835511373824)

**what i did:**

- i learned about TEMPLATE LITERALS and coded to display ALL the hotels returned from the API (thanks to the map() method learnt yesterday)
inside an html paragraph EACH!!! 
- i started styling the "injected" paragraph with CSS. great!!! 
- i got to know Amadeus API much better and it's actually a great API lol : many cities available / IMAGES POSSIBLE (test images but still!!!) + many more features i did ignore.

**what i learned:**

A LOT!!!

- template literals syntax: BACKTICKS! + ${} (placeholder for variable/parameter) : so handy + allows dynamic behaviour!!!
- insertAdjacentHTML() method!!! : i find it better/somehow easier to use  than the .createElement() method! .createElement used to blow my mind but insertAdjacentHTML is way cooler!!! beforeBegin/beforeEnd etc... parameter is perfect.
- how to "inject" html dynamically to display the json data i want!!

**next:**

- HANDLE WRITING INPUT (city name)!!! YES!!! it will make the app look/feel professional/REAL etc... DO IT!!!
- ADD IMAGES (eventhough test images, it's ok!) + hotel description to the results page!!!
- finish the STYLING!!! HURRY UP!!!

- UPDATE BLOG AND EXPLAIN ALL THAT!!!
