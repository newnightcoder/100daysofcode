**LOG R1D10** (24/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1209351622687707136)

**what i did:**
- worked on the Tschichold pen with grid-areas! much better result.
- updated the Prince tribute page with flexbox for the gifs section!!! finally!!! 


**what i learned:**
- grid-areas: so much easier to design your grid and make your layout perfect (or almost, at this point :))
- flexbox { flex-wrap:wrap; } 
/*-------yeah!!!*/


**next step:**
- keyframes (to animate the lines on Tschichold)
- min and max sizing for the grid
