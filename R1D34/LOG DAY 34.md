**what i did:**

- i made the ball move in the canvas! it's falling from whatever point i choose + speed control.

**what i learned:**

- i'm now actually learning/searching how to make it collide with the borders of the canvas and the paddle!
it requires a well thought-out condition... i dn't know which one + it involves some basic maths thinking so i have to really get to it or be patient for the eureka moment. 
- to make a sketch is important! stop THINKING everything and USE PAPER/A PLAN OF ACTION. it helps VISUALIZE.

**next step:**

- collisions collisions collisions!!!
