**LOG R3D03** (06/08/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1291257111092092928)


**what i did:**

- i learned a lot about DNS requests + DNSSEC (resolver/recursive resolver, public key cryptography, chain of trust...)
- refactored my app.js code to create my **components** 
- used **props** for the first time!!!

**what i learned:**

- .trim() method: to remove white spaces => can be used with .length to check if there are white spaces in a string element (in an input for example):
```
if (string.trim().length === 0) return;  //same as: if(string === '') return 
```
- how to pass/share state between "sibling" components / how to handle state!!! (at the highest level possible, declared once, then passed to the components thanks to props!)
*cf* code of the day - lot of new syntax/new thinking but really makes sense + feels so handy!!!
 
**next:**

- continue with props + more refactoring?

- implement localstorage
- animations
- scrollable div
- darkmode

- ~refactor code to **create COMPONENTS**~
- ~check and delete functionalities of the todo app.~

- commit files or code to github via terminal.
