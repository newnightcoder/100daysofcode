**what i did:**
- i finally rewrote the CSS of my Prince tribute page using SASS!!! i've wanted to do that for a while now!
thank you so much to [Tim Robards](https://twitter.com/TimJRob) for his THOROUGH [Sass explanantions](https://itnext.io/starting-with-sass-116f4ecb682d) in Medium.
- started trying to apply the DRY principle as much as possible. 
it is so classy and most importantly more easily maintainable! 

**what i learned:**
- SCSS variables and mixins, nesting + use of ampersand (the & sign): so cool!!!

**next step:**
- look into the @extend functionality, i need it for sure!
- ALWAYS USE SASS when starting any project from now on and forever.
