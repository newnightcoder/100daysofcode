link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1222399027154751488)

**what i did:**

- i manipulated the fucking DOM lol. i go from the play menu to pause menu using menu.style.display to "manipulate" the CSS! + by pressing the spacebar!
- home and start menus are done! / i have to write their manipulation code now!!
- i searched the proper conditions to go out of pause mode with spacebar! not ready yet...
- it looks like a (somewhat) REAL game!!

**what i learned:**

- how to modify the html/css with JS!! at the end of the day it's extremely easy lol! hahaha!
- also yeah, JS and CSS are really working just perfect together! was it intended? is it on purpose??? i have to find and read the whole History of JS.
- thanks to [Ashley](https://twitter.com/CrashleyGames) i learned about the forEach() array method!!! so it does exactly what its name means!!! it calls a function ONCE! FOR EACH element of an array.
it is so great to learn about JS functions and tricks through an experienced coder like Ashley!!! the example/reality of the function through her own project made it so tangible/not abstract anymore/crystal clear! that's also why/how i know i will LOVE pair programming at the beginning of my career!! even later with more experience, i'll do it with newer devs than me!!! just perfect.  

**next:**

- how to go out of pause menu? almost there so find out asap!
- let's do it for home and start menus!! let's go.
- THE OTHER LEVELS!!! NOW. URGENT.
