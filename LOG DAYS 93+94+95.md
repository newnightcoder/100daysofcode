**what i did:**

- after 2 days of doubt/despair LOL i could FINALLY use/target the data I WANTED from the json arrays of data received by Amadeus API 
- i could display it ON the app!!! 

**what i learned:**

- thanks to the help of Jon and Ashley (both told me about the data.data trick!!!) i realized that my problem was in the DATA variable name!!! i can actually CHOOSE it, everything is so clear now.
- i have to be careful because my judgement can be altered because of anxiety/not succeeding as quickly as i want = LEARN PATIENCE + TRUE RESILIENCE!!! the solution will ALWAYS be found (with or without help)

**next:**

- how to handle user input? connect it to the API call!!!!
- style the app in order to display the data nicely!!
