**what i did:**

- i finally could FIX the restart button!!! simple html link of course! i had to go out of the gameStates logic and come back to the very basics! awesome!
- some more styling/css/creativity (intro)
- still on it!

**what i learned:**

- practiced some css tricks (animations, delay etc...)
- the creative part of the game is as important as the "logic". it really enhances "player experience" even if simple/small details. 

**next:**

FIX LAST 2 ISSUES TO RELEASE THE GAME:

- fix resetBall() PERFECTLY (it's possible!! find out, apply step by step method)
- fix SCORE display! 

AND:

- implement ball ANGLE  *NOW!!!!!!!*
- fix minibug ball/paddle.  *we'll see! it's a cute bug after all..*
