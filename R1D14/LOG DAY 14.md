**what i did:**
- i coded for a second Tschichold (symmetry) and it went smoothly with grid areas and grid units.
- it is not wow perfect, but i do get the responsive layout aspect of things now. 

**what i learned:**
- i consolidated my knowledge of grid.
- basic introduction to datastructures thanks to this GREAT [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM) for total beginners like me (5 types: linked lists, arrays, hash tables, stack & queue, graphs and trees).
- from now on, i have to learn about DATASTRUCTURES and ALGORYTHMS more and more!!! it's fascinating and interesting asf!!!
while learning coding.

**next step:**
- wrap up css basics: navbar-menu/parallax/animations.
- rewrite all my css with SASS : i need to do a SASS week or at least 3-4 days in a row asap!
