link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1230029899810902016)

**what i did:**

- i continued fixing many design bugs and coded to improve the game in general. still on it.
- i could create an html element and style it in JS (for the RESTART game menu).

**what i learned:**

- how to document.createElement()!!! = let *varName* = document.createElement('*element*') // *varName*.innerHTML ='text' // document.body.appendChild(*varName*)  

**next:**

CLEAR THE CHECKLIST TO FINISH THE GAME!!

- ~~implement GAME STATS~~
- ~~implement SPACEBAR for ALL BUTTONS!!! not only pause.~~
- ~~create winStates~~
- ~~RE-CREATE the overall DESIGN according to new decision.~~
- ~~finish the ENDING~~
- CREATE GAME RULES SCREEN 

and:

- FINALLY implement ball ANGLE
- fix minibug ball/paddle AND THAT'S A WRAP.
