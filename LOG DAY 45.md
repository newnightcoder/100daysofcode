**LOG R1D45** (28/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1222037339985281024)

**what i did:**

- i did not plan it but finally i didn't code/work tonight! 
- it was [Sara](https://twitter.com/DetentionTech)'s last day of the challenge and we were many fellow learners/coders to congratulate on her twitter. She was one of the very first to support me when i started and was struggling with CSS and my prince tribute page! 
the [100 Days Of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) community is truly amazing!!! i am so happy to have met/meet so many interesting people. this is deeply beautiful + i might meet some of them in reality in a JS or React conference one day maybe!!! who knows! that's so fun! + i want to go to dev conferences around the world. it is my dream now!
- great catching-up on facetime with TÃ³mas (his upcoming netflix projects! and my life now with the code learning/my future as a developer) 
- i found some more MINDBLOWING devs on codepen!!! the inspiration NEVER stops!!! it's like in contemporary art but x100 i think. (+ there is web contemporary art somehow! i love Nathan Tokyo. he did this [end of the world](http://eotw.nathan.tokyo/) project: that could totally be a video/performance installation it's just perfect in all senses.)
- i watched some YT  motivation videos + pro tips, just enjoying my new life in general and the community.
- OMG i discovered COLLAB LAB!

**what i learned:**

- COLLAB LAB: this is EXACTLY what i have to do right after round 2. (why not round 1 in april if progress keeps increasing? 
i want but i am not sure i'll be ready. anyways! the most important is that IT EXISTS!!! PAIR PROGRAMMING  for real!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
- it is good to sometimes just pause and appreciate all there is around me. those moments give me deep energy and of course inspiration for later.
- someone said that learning to code for real is like go hide in a cave for several months and then go out back into the world lol. it's true for me! + intensity of this challenge/personal bootcamp. BUT i have to get out of the cave from time to time, that's cool 
- twitter is real parallel world. for the moment i enjoy it so much. (do not become addicted)

**next:**

- SAME AS YESTERDAY! BACK TO REALITY - WORK!!! :
- finish css.
- manipulate the fucking DOM lol.
- finish game states.
- RELEASE THE GAME!!
