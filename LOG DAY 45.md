**LOG R1D45** (28/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1222037339985281024)

**what i did:**

- i did not plan it but finally i didn't code/work tonight! 
- it was [Sara](https://twitter.com/DetentionTech)'s last day of the challenge and we were many fellow learners/coders to congratulate on her twitter. the [100 Days Of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) community is truly amazing!!! i am so happy to . have met/meet so many interesting people. this is deeply beautiful.
- then catch-up on facetime with TÃ³mas until 4 (his upcoming netflix projects! and my life now with the code learning/my future as a web developer) 
- i found some more MINDBLOWING devs on codepen!!! the inspiration NEVER stops!!! it's like in contemporary art but x100 i think. (+ there is web contemporary art! i love Nathan Tokyo. he did this [end of the world](http://eotw.nathan.tokyo/) project: that could totally be a video/performance installation it's just perfect in all senses.)
- i watched some YT  motivation videos + pro tips, just enjoying my new life in general and the community.
- OMG i discovered COLLAB LAB!

**what i learned:**

- COLLAB LAB: this is what i have to do right after round 2. (why not round 1 in april if progress keeps increasing like that? well, i want but i am not sure i'll be ready. anyways! the most important is that IT EXISTS!!! PAIR PROGRAMMING  for real!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
- it is good to sometimes just pause and appreciate all there is around me. those moments give me deep energy and of course inspiration for later.

**next:**

- SAME AS YESTERDAY! BACK TO REALITY - WORK!!! :
- finish css.
- manipulate.
- finish game states.
- RELEASE THE GAME!!
