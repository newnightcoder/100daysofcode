**LOG R3D12** (04/09/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1301762023668228096)


**what i did:**

- i'm back to code!!! i had an unexpected break of 2-3 weeks, i had fun, but now is really time to get back to work and learning. i want a jump in knowledge / build my portfolio!!!
- i started to redesign the todo-app, feels much better to work on that (inspiration form Dribble!!!)
- back to React / reading my code and refreshing about react structure, state etc...
- i could implement date and time component easily!! (now: vanilla or moment.js)

**what i learned:**

- React refresher!!


**next:**

- find the missing part to implement FILTER FUNCTIONALITY (either with useState, useReducer or back to class component)
- general styling:
  - animations
  - scrollable div
  - darkmode
  
- ~DEBUG THE TODO RENDERING!!! it was working perfectly fine with class component + the code makes sense! so fix the problem.~  
- ~**finish rewriting the code as clean as possible: functional components (with react hook useState()) + CSS-in-JS**~
- ~now that everything is cleaner: implement LOCALSTORAGE!!!~ 
- ~continue with props + more refactoring to make **functional compononents**~
- ~refactor code to **create COMPONENTS**~
- ~check and delete functionalities of the todo app.~
- commit files or code to github via terminal.
