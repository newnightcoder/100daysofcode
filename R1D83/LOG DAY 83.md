**LOG R1D83** (06/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1235815476078342144)

**what i did:**

- i finally installed POSTMAN. it looks very friendly/handy but still i could NOT find HOW to get my token with it...

**what i learned:**

- i learned about axios! it sounds great but not for now. i have to get my fetch() method to work first.
- why postman is so useful!

**feelings:**

- i feel somewhat "discouraged" and disheartened. i find it extremely frustrating to be stuck at such an easy stage.
- it creates doubts / maybe i should not have started an app like this. 
- i have to stay strong, focus and it will work. i would LOVE to make an app like this!!! it would be great actually.
- i would love to have a course/tutorial/discussion with a human about how to make it work. i need an example... (ask for it if nothing more happens)

**next:**

same thing as yesterday and the day before:

- POST request via POSTMAN to get the token.
- if it doesn't work, ask for help and get started!! 

- NOTION: update technical blog! + archiving until up to date!
