link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1251045058679365632)


**what i did:**

- i managed to display the data on the worldmap!!! with map() + forEach() and a function addMarker() inside the forEach!!! it's working nicely!!
- in order to "succeed", i did PSEUDO-CODE on paper to clarify what i wanted : awesome!!!
- use of filter() method to display only countries with x amount of confirmed cases (10k, but i can choose anything! cool!!)
- styling of the markers (circles)
- started working/thinking about how to animate the circles pulse/radar style.


**what i learned**

- how to properly use forEach!! i tried many things several times and finally could get it right!!! = LEARNING BY DOING!
- i understand the difference between map() and forEach() better.
- importance of pseudo-coding!!! again ;)


**next:**

- circles ANIMATION!!!
- change FONT on the MAP 
- "convert" json timestamp footer into REGULAR DATE + TIME !!
- display data on a chart.js graph for the right section
- dark/light mode TOGGLE!!!
- ~display DATA ON THE MAP!!~ : *solved*

- ~TOGGLE between confirmed/deaths/recovered!!!~ : *solved with .innerHTML!* 
- ~use proper ARRAY METHODS to display the data!!!~ : *solved*
