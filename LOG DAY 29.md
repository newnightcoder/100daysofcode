**what i did:**

- i saw friends, cooked some chicken, and slept well.

**what i learned:**

- it's important to have a balance. a binging attitude is not productive at all.
- i should maybe sleep like that once a week...
- to take a break is great because now i feel so motivated and i do believe that i will manage to finish arkanoid mini.
- i realized that even if it takes me 30 days to finish, i'll still have 40 days left of the challenge! and i'll be so much stronger in JS then! to make a second project! 
that's actually awesome when i think about it! i have time! but i refuse to take 30 days for the game of course. 15 days would be correct.

**next step:**

same as yesterday:
- finish to rewrite all the code i can (multiple times).
- work on the paddle keyboard control.
