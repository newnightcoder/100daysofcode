link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1211565620376014848)

**what i did:**
- i played further on my new playground pen (nightcoder.io header) and it's nice to see that i type quicker, 
i find the errors quickly and everything comes much more "fluently".

**what i learned:**
- syntax for animations and transitions
- difference between animations and transitions
- x, y, z axes! of course! had forgotten about all that lol.
- i have an overall better knowledge of CSS and all it can do (layout, responsiveness, animations and transitions).
- some limitations of CSS. i have some things in mind that are impossible without JS i think! i want to start learning JS!!! lol

**next step:**
- SVG ANIMATIONS!
- rewrite all CSS of all pens with SASS !!!!!!!!!!
