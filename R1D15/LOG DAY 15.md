**what i did:**
- i finally started css animations!! could't wait! i coded to animate my header "nightcoder.io" with a linear-gradient. 

**what i learned:**
- @keyframes 
- -webkit 
- linear/radial gradient

**next step:**
- intensive use of figma to learn about how to make beautiful gradients + svg/text animations etc...
- further with css animations.
- look further into -webkit and all the other prefixes!
