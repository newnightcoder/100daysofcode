link to my daily tweet [here]()

**what i did:**

- i finally fixed one major issue i had: make the bricks disappear when hit by the ball! it works perfectly now. the game is fun!!
- i coded for level2 to appear when level1 is cleared, but i could not find WHERE to put the functions... should it be linked to the array when creating or drawing the bricks or both? or how?
- level2 showed up suddenly at the start of the game, so it's here! 

**what i learned:**

- i'm quicker to fix syntax and take the logical path.
- i need to practice more and more but i feel confident.

**next:**

- fix level2. if it works, level 3 will be done as well and the game almost ready.
- implement sounds.
- create score.
