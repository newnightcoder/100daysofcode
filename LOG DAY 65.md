**LOG R1D65** (17/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1229291598518915072)

**what i did:**

- i implemented the game STATS!! (life, score and level). adds A LOT!!! makes even more REAL. happy.
- i started implementing spacebar for "everything" (except home screen because mouse needed there).
- i decided to change the overall design and let go of my design "statement" of the mini canvas. the game takes anoter dimension when played directly on Arkanoid's original tiles! F**K lol.

**what i learned:**

- how to display text and images on the canvas! so handy and interesting, i should use it again but "mixed" with document.createElement (for winScreen)!!
- what i heard is true: as a "game dev" you have to let go of some of your "personal specifications" to please the maximum players (don't be unflexible/stuck on your view and admit things/be able to adapt).
though it was an interesting design statement, the mini canvas will have to go. it will boost the GAME sensation. tried it adopted it. let's move on. a bit sad but this is for the better. (or find another way to use it. or let go, as decided.)

**next:**

CLEAR THE CHECKLIST TO FINISH THE GAME!!

- ~~implement GAME STATS~~
- ~~implement SPACEBAR for ALL BUTTONS!!! not only pause.~~
- create transition screens (winScreens).
- RE-CREATE the overall DESIGN according to new decision.
- CREATE GAME RULES SCREEN 
- finish the ENDING.

and:

- FINALLY implement ball ANGLE
- fix minibug ball/paddle AND THAT'S A WRAP.
