**LOG R1D28** (11/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1215878347835813889)

**what i did:**

- i erased everything and tried to rewrite as much as possible of the code FROM SCRATCH.
- great exercise to use brain+memory to fully train my JS syntax+logic. FUNDAMENTAL.

**what i learned:**

- i realized tonight that i still hadn't done that with JS!!! and i used to do it almost everyday when learning html and css. 
to ERASE + REWRITE from scratch is the BEST way for me to understand and retain. maximum benefit.
- i should have done that earlier this week but i was taken by the excitement of making the paddle move completely since the 5px..
- i also realized that arkanoid mini is my first real project ever and JS isn't easy like html/css of course! what was i thinking??
so the game will take the time required. 
it is so important to master each baby step + there is really no rush (within a reasonable amount of days of course). 
i do fully understand it now, and i accept it. i have actually really started to learn JS!!! it was such a far away dream a few weeks ago...

**next step:**

- finish to rewrite all the code i can (multiple times) until i get it naturally (like for html/css!!!) 
- solve the paddle control problem next week latest. push yourself.
- once solution found for the paddle: erase and rewrite again.
