**what i did:**

- i started the "under construction" landing page of my covid-19 dataviz project!! i got the idea yesterday when i realized that it will take me some time to finish for real.
and i need/want! to put some work online in the meantime! so this is the best idea.
- creative part of the process: image research + figma mockup
- i'm now in the middle of coding the page with css-grid!


**what i learned**

- this idea/mini project is awesome because it's a perfect CSS-grid refresher!! i had no real intense CSS practice recently so that's the perfect occasion to get back to it NOW!
- i remember the power of grid!! i find it difficult right now, i have to re-PRACTICE it all night and have fun!
- **use of Firefox for grid** is awesome indeed!!! 
- to push myself to produce something in a timeframe is a good thing. positive pressure right now!!


**next:**

- get the landing page ready and put it online ASAP!!
