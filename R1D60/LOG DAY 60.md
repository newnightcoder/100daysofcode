**LOG R1D60** (12/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1227486080376745984)

**what i did:**

- i asked for help yesterday because i felt like i was stuck on repeat (lol), not making any progress in my game levels investigation.
- it gave me a renewed/refreshed energy to get back to the code with a different approach and i could write it much better/reorganize it.
- i coded for 'pause'! it's back again! 
- i "merged" and rewrote the drawBricks() function! i had not seen that earlier.. good thing!

**what i learned:**

- to ask for help was a good idea indeed, it induces a different king of learning/energy. i think it will be extremely beneficial because both Nathan and Laszlo are helping, so it will bring me some new perspective for sure.
- the dev community (but i already knew it) is so helpful/generous: Janel and JavascriptPlumber also offered to review my code! extremely nice.

**next:**

- continue the investigation
- let's implement the sounds and some more CSS while the "code review/help" is happening.
