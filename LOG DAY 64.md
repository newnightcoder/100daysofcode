**what i did:**

- dm assistance
- i finished implementing the soundtrack for the game
- i started working on the ENDING of the game! had not seen it coming nor thought about it prior to now, just had a vague idea, so there is a lot to do creatively.

**what i learned:**

- i consolidated my practice of sounds and had to reorganize some code to get it all to work nicely.
- *soundName*.pause() : of course! JS is awesome, we already know that at this point lol.

**next:**

CLEAR THE CHECKLIST TO FINISH THE GAME!!

- implement GAME STATS!!! (do not start to be scared again, totally easy and possible. start/do it.)
- finish the ENDING.
- create transition screens (levels).
- implement SPACEBAR for ALL BUTTONS!!! not only pause.
- CREATE GAME RULES SCREEN

and:

- FINALLY implement ball ANGLE
- fix minibug ball/paddle AND THAT'S A WRAP.
