**LOG R1D58** (10/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1226745600714182656)

**what i did:**

- i had a nice coding session doing a more thorough review of every parts of my code.
- i understood/fixed the brick problem (sofar) and could identify the huge problem induced by my code for "pause" (keyboard control): interference with gameStates etc...
- i ended tonight's session on a new lead: i should maybe create a new state to "transition" between current and next level. it would give me more control over things right now, eventhough maybe deemed superficial from a professional standpoint (but i don't know that so let's do it + this project is my JS learning tool for the moment so let's resort to whatever's needed to make the code/logic work. rewriting/refactoring for the better will happen at a later stage of the journey for sure, and it'll be so much fun!!! for now, let's just learn + understand + make it work)

**what i learned:**

- again, more about the syntax + i am not far from finding the solution. to see the levels display automatically eventhough not at the right time made me quite happy and renews ny energy: it IS possible!
- to go/code step by step helps a lot to "locate" the issues.
- i should definitely use a PAPER PLAN again. i didn't PSEUDO CODE and i should be doing that. 

**next:**

- it would be a good thing to take the time to pseudo code all this, eventhough pressure of time is felt.
- fix "everything" and work on sounds!
