**LOG R1D13** (27/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1210437629914820608)

**what i did:**
- i rewrote my Tschichold pen and it works! beautiful flexibility.
- i inserted a media query that i fully control. 

**what i learned:**
- i now get the grid, the grid areas and the flexibility units (min/max-content, vmin/vmax, i understand minmax() as well)!
- use of chrome dev tools definitely.
- i don't know but the use of a media query isn't satisfying at all, somehow... i'm sure there is a better way with grid.. 
FEATURE QUERY instead? 

**next step:**
- learn about feature query/fallout design.
- new Tschichold
- css animations
