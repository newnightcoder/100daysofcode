link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1218767331893096448)

**what i did:**

- i coded for the ball to collide with the borders of the canvas! 
- used the Math.random() method to make the ball fall RANDOMLY!!! it adds so much to the GAME of course!!! i am happy.

**what i learned:**

a lot!

- pay close attention to the operators and what they MEAN: += or -= are different from =+ or =- etc... IMPORTANT TO MASTER QUICKLY! NOW!
- Math.random() method: amazing.
- break down the functions in smaller functions!!! my problem when coding for the ball collisions came also from the fact that i tried to declare everything in moveBall() and that was NOT a good idea.
it is very important to always try and narrow functions down to ONE THING. much easier, much clearer. 

**next step:**

- FUNDAMENTAL!! : REWRITE the code with paddle and ball as OBJECTS!!! not just a list of variables like that, it is really amateurish.
always CREATE JS OBJECTS when needing... objects! so obvious! stop with the endless list of variables + it will help organise the code/make it classy.
- collisions ball-paddle!!!! and the game will start to be alive!!!
