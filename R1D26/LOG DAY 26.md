**what i did:**

- i decided to "play" with functions. i created a draw function by myself and a loop function and they work!!

**what i learned:**

- how functions work.
- i started to see them as possible "variables" within other "bigger" or more powerful functions. that's how came the NEED/idea for a draw function!
- it is all clearer in my mind now, i start to really understand JS and this thing with the position of the code up or down!
of course!: you MUST declare a function before you can invoke it! so obvious.
- functions are super flexible and open-minded, everything almost is possible with them.
- i am not scared and impressed by the syntax anymore + the CONSOLE is really fantastic. 
- i get the "constructor" thing now and hence: this. etc.. so logical = a way to create a new object (but object literal first for now)
- i start to really get super attracted to JS and i start to fathom the immensity of possibilities = POWER OF FUNCTIONS! (the word recursion doesn't scare me anymore also. i want to know more!)
- i am writing functions for shapes and colors and animation effect and loops, but i could also be writing them to go get datas/information/anything from somewhere and show it to my users, on MY layout haha! i think that's why everybody is talking about data! it all feels less abstract to me now)

**next step:**

- understand the idea of an update function. what does it do? why do i need it? do i need it? find out.
- relax and FIND the right function declaration/logic to control the paddle with the arrowkeys. it HAS to be found/done.
- draw the ball (it still doesn't work though the code seems acceptable + it's easy!)
