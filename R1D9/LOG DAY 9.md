**what i did:**
- played a lot on my Tschichold pen, trying to get the perfect layout with grid, some things work some others don't in term of layout result. 
- i used flexbox, finally! super easy to get.

**what i learned:**
- easyness of flexbox to center and align things perfectly.

**next step:**
- finish this pen / css animations
