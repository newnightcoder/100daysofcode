**LOG R2D8** (19/04/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1251814509553033219)


**what i did:**

- i dived into looking for a way to ANIMATE the circles on the map and it brought me to SVGs!!! 
- i could CODE my very first SVG circle!!! (for the marker on the map) and of course it looks so much better than the google maps API's circle because it's VECTORIAL: absolute perfection.
- i couldn't get to the animating part though. it seems much more difficult...


**what i learned**

- SVGs!!!! SVGs are perfect!! they can be used like img, but also CODE!
- how to code for an SVG (XML)
- ```<animate> tag!!! (but also <circle>, <rect> etc...)
- learned about SVG PATH but it's difficult, i have to get into it + understand all the attributes possible for <animate>!! or try *Inkscape*???


**next:**

- SVG ANIMATION!!!
- display the footer even better than it is now: play with moment.js or new Date() constructor.
- change FONT on the MAP 
- display data on a chart.js graph for the right section
- dark/light mode TOGGLE!!!
- ~"convert" json timestamp footer into REGULAR DATE + TIME !!~ : *solved with .toString().replace(regEx, $1)*
- ~display DATA ON THE MAP!!~ : *solved*
- ~design of my dashboard : *in progress* => INCLUDE WORLDMAP!~
- ~TOGGLE between confirmed/deaths/recovered!!!~ : *solved with .innerHTML!* 
- ~use proper ARRAY METHODS to display the data!!!~ : *solved* 
- ~get the covid-19 data in the console = solve the fetch() issue / fix the header~ : *solved*
