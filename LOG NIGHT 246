**LOG R3D46** (08/10/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1314107887174770693)


**what i did:**

- first real kata on codewars using regex (vowels replacement!! with `/[aeiou]/gi`) : ðŸ¤©
- portfolio design, i'm slow doing that, not sure waht style to chose etc... but it's fun! 

**what i learned:**

- regexr is really cool!!! (regex101 as well) 
- RegEx have their own construction/syntax! once that understood, it's absolutely not scary anymore!! just very handy + super precise everything you can do. each syntax is a bit like a new parameter you add to the pattern you want to define!
awesome.
- i really like CODEWARS!!!

**next:**

- codewars everyday
- HACKTOBERFEST 
- set up PORTFOLIO DESIGN / html-css
