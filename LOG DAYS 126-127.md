**LOG R2D26-27** (11/05/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1259860331352018944)


**what i did:**

- i started to work with [clockify](https://clockify.me) and it's absolutely amazing!! 
- i cut each part of the project and of the learning into smaller tasks etc.. = much better planning, i should've started that earlier!
the benefits are huge.
- i did 1 hour of blog writing each day + 1 hour of freecodecamp challenges
- i could get the axes to show on the graph (still have to fix the ticks of the x axis + the margin convention)
- tooltips are also working


**what i learned**

- time management / better focus with clockify
- i started to feel the NEED for async functions!! so i learned about that and will implement as soon as the graph is ready.
- so much about d3, there is a lot to grasp, it's being both so fun and very challenging. i think it's a good exercise to be learning and using it right now.


**next:**

- finish chart 1.
