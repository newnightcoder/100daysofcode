link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1272624385078300673)


**what i did:**

- no code really
- i watched/learned how to delete/update the to-dos / how to best go about building a to-do app

**what i learned**

- localStorage!!! : to store data in the browser! i had NEVER heard about it and i think it's really awesome
- the to-dos need to have an id/index in a storage array!! of course!! it allows to target each one individually.

**next:**

SAME!
- fix refreshButton rotation onclick behaviour
- fix userWarning disappear animation onclick behaviour
- implement select and delete item
