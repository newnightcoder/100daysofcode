**LOG R2D25** (08/05/20)

**what i did:**

- i reworked the whole layout of the dashboard to implement CSS grid and stop this absolute positioning chaos lol!!!
- created new sections, everything is under grid (SVGs will be in their "placeholder" etc..)!! it feels/looks better, much steadier!!
- i found some ideas regarding the "story" of my dataviz.
- i started the 1hour a day of writing for my technical blog, it will be the best way to progress and catch up on eveything i have to write!
- i installed **clockify**: perfect!!! it's already helping me focus more and better.

**what i learned**

- it gets so much easier with CSS grid, i could play with areas and span syntax, experiment with grid, and i saw details i had never noticed before (particularly regarding the box-model!!)
- i realize even more how great **Firefox is for CSS GRID**!! i used it further, could see all the details in the grid, and finally get the "perfect" layout (as i wanted it and WITHOUT absolute positioning)


**next:**

- **gather all the data needed for this project**
- think of + create dynamic interactions with user!
