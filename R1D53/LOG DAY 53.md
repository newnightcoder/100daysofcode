**LOG R1D53** (05/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1224928547426443264)

**what i did:**

- a lot: i rewrote a whole part of the logic to introduce the 4 levels BETTER! and they appear without any problem when i set gameState on corresponding level!!!
- i'm on the right track now!!
- i designed levels 2/3/4 much better! (i modified almost everything, createBricks and drawBricks L2 and L3 etc...+ new gameState for each level helps me)

**what i learned:**

- progress in my programming logic! i could fix many inconsistencies "easily" after just trying and getting it!
- JS and programming in general makes more and more sense! it was a very productive coding session because i could fix so much on my own! very satisfying.

**next:**

- now that REAL/further groundwork has been fixed/done for the levels, make them appear "automatically". no fear needed, it was a very good session tonite. almost done.
- sounds sounds sounds LOL!!!!
