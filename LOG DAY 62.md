link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1228211917602226176)

**what i did:**

- i didn't code finally. i just chilled and spent some time on twitter lol.
- i decided to actually start giving back NOW to the dev community by offering to help absolute beginners with html/css fundamentals and discuss code-learning related issues if they want. it's been in my mind for a while now so i just started! thanks to the energy boost provided by [Javascript Teacher](https://twitter.com/js_tut). He mentioned me in a tweet encouraging people to follow twitter-active coders he finds interesting.everything started to explode from that moment! just amazing/beautiful/encouraging/PERFECT. 


**next:**

- back to work: implement sounds.
