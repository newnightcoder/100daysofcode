**LOG R1D1** (14/12/19)

link to my first daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1205985268320395265)

so i started the challenge!

**what i did:**
- i stumbled across an excellent exercise for me at this point (html/simple css) : build a tribute webpage. i chose Prince.
idea submitted on codepen by freecodecamp (link to the exercise [here](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/details/NNvBQW))
- so i did a mockup with figma and then tried to code the basics, using css positioning, very cringy and disastrous result lol. made me want to use css grid for real now, because many images etc...

**what i learned:**
- how to use figma + importance of resizing images beforehand, else it gets messy...
- usage of css variables, em units, some positioning..
- how valuable css grid and flexbox must be! have to practice it from now on.

**feeling:**
- i am extremely happy, feel motivated to climb the mountain (it's still easy now).
- disappointed by the overall aspect of the page after so much time spent codeing and figuring things out.
- the main problem came with the background images etc... size/proportions/impossible alignment/size of the body etc...
- but so happy to take the challenge and finally get to code for real! great feeling!!
