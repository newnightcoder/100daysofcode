**what i did:**

- tonight i spent over an hour trying to figure out why the ball i'm coding for (through a classic draw function) is NOT working/showing on the game canvas...
- i literally tried everything logical + the console is super quiet so my code is somewhat okay! reminds me of the paddle situation lol.

**what i learned:**

- i learned that right now, something is missing in my code. i have to find out what exactly.

**next step:**

- is my looped game function (with requestAnimFrame) having an "impact" on any other drawing i would want to make? find out.
- the ball + its collisions everywhere!!! make some fun happen!
