**what i did:**

- i finished the transition from home menu to start game, and game to pause state.
- still have to find the proper function for the start game button!! + out of pause state!
- i cleaned the scss and (re)discovered the connection html/js now that i know js!! cf onclick event in the html tag to invoke a JS function! just cool.

**what i learned:**

- i am quite "fluent" with Sass, no problem with actual knowledge. i am ready for next level = go back to Sass resources and learn.
- js in html tag! of course, but at the time i didn't know JS so that made just no sense! now it's an option i can decide to chose or not according to what i want!!! i SEE a progress, that's great.
- consolidated the very basics of DOM manipulation, so much so that it's being just pure fun! of course: it is like "declarative" JS, like CSS is, so it is relaxing in comparison to function thinking/logical programming LOL

**next:**

- out of pause!! (spaceBar or click? both!!! just find out.)
- LIFE-- / GAMEOVER (they still don't really exist!)
- access to other LEVELS
- what about BABEL? let's learn about it and why not for this project? let's see (if it's quick, do it. good thing to do from the very beginning of the journey.)
