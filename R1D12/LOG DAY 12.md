**LOG R1D12** (26/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1210055339565027329)

**what i did:**
- worked more precesely on Tschichold: i start to really understand the role of vmin as well as min and max-content but not 100%...
(experiment/play with the units to see the effect ===> i feel the "learning by doing" thing a lot!)
- designing using CHROME DEV TOOLS for the first time! amazing to see the results on phones and ipads!!! 

**what i learned:**
- this pen definitely will take longer for me to finish than expected but i also learn so much through it!!! 
- i control my media quieries even more and more thanks to dev tools! 

**next step:**
- finish this pen and start the other Tschichold i have in mind, to make sure i really master the thing.
- have to try MOZ DEV TOOLS, i've heard they're even better for grid! who knows for JS... :P
- re-write my css with SASS!! (especially the Prince tribute page)
