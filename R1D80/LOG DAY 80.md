link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1234731973534474240) 

**what i did:**

- i subscribed to Amadeus API and could get my own key. i couldn't get to retrieve the json data as i wanted. i don't know how to use this API key.
- i tried TravelgateX and their API sounds awesome as well, but could not get past the example/test doc..
- i don't know how to start my JS code / make the API call / get the JSON data in the browser and choose what i want!!
- i did some more styling of the app/design. fun!

**what i learned:**

- what an API key is and more about how an API works. i get it better.
- thanks to Laszlo and Jon replying to my daily tweet, i now know i'll have to look into the TOKEN i'm missing right now.
- fetch() method to get the data! to LEARN

**next:**

- API CALL
