**what i did:**

- i decided to try to code for a STARFIELD using objects/OOP and it worked!!! i was inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM) of Daniel Schiffman where he does it with Processing (Java). it's amazing.
- i jumped to the object part of Colt Steele's course.

**what i learned**

A LOT!!!
- first: it's been a refresher to work with canvas again!!! it had been such a long time and really like it!!
- **constructor function** + new Object() : awesome!!!
- THIS keyword : referring to the object!! (depends on the context: global/function/object)
- i used the new Array() method: very handy to set length of the array!
- focal length/projection for deepness effect on canvas!!

**next:**

- try to animate a sort of paddle and let's see.
