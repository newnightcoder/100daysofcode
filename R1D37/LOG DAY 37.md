**LOG R1D37** (20/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1219142516399919104)

**what i did:**

- i coded for the ball to COLLIDE with the PADDLE! it works nicely and i spent some time playing with them lol! (except for a little bug when xBall = xPaddle or something like that... i have to verify and debug asap!!)
- i also started to code for the situation when the paddle doesn't catch the ball and the player loses a life (out of 3 lives or more, to decide later)
- i searched how to create a reset function for the ball after the player has lost a life (but still haven't found the proper conditions yet..)

**what i learned:**

- i strengthened my understanding of logical/"mathematical" conditions, by just coding/trying and seeing the actual result in the game!
- now that i need to create the BRICKS, i know that i will need to get to the study of arrays (syntax, how does it work, everything...)

**next step:**

- like yesterday: rewrite the code with paddle and ball as OBJECTS (the bricks as well! if possible). 
- create the bricks with an array.
