**what i did:**

- i finished implementing the DELETE functionality! = the to-do app is ready!
- weather app almost implemented! (still more styling to do + user geolocation)

**what i learned**

- array.splice(i, 1) : to remove 1 item from index!!
- refresh: fetch! i want to learn how to use async / await now. urgent!
- i felt confident trying different things with my own code and finally everything worked fine! i know i'll have to REFACTOR A LOT!!! but later. for now, i have to finish.

**next:**

- user geolocation
- pomodoro app
- pocket-calculator

TO POLISH:
- weather CSS: improve styling!! 
- implement select item : rewrite the code better
- fix refreshButton rotation onclick behaviour: in progress
- fix userWarning disappear animation onclick behaviour : in progress
- ~finish implementing DELETE from the localStorage array, almost there!~
- ~finish implementing storage of the items: on screen persistence~ 
- ~implement delete item~
