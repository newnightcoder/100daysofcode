**what i did:**

- i implemented the DELETE functionality!!
- CSS styling / tried to fix the refreshButton rotate animation but not perfect yet (it rotates both ways, that's not really what i want..)
- tried to fix the userWarning animation but it's not really working

**what i learned**

- event.target with eventListener!! : awesome to determine WHERE the user is clicking
- parentNode / parentElement : to get to the HTML parent of an element, just awesome!!!

**next:**

- implement storage of the items
- implement select item 
- fix refreshButton rotation onclick behaviour: in progress
- fix userWarning disappear animation onclick behaviour : in progress
- ~implement delete item~
