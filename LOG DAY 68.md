**LOG R1D68** (20/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1230393932552556545)

**what i did:**

- like yesterday: i continued TRACKING/fixing bugs (so i played the game quite a lot lol) and coded to improve the game DESIGN in general. still on it.
- i created displayLevelName() dynamically, so much better, total freedom as i wanted, i'm not canvas-dependent anymore!! so great.

**what i learned:**

- i coded fluently and could create my levelName element so easily. i SEE the articulation of the logic so CLEARLY now and how much REFACTORING i should actually be doing (cf Nathan's template!!!).
- i see/understand/practice the relationship between JS and CSS.
- to create elements dynamically can have great benefits as i see it (at this very early stage though). i have to investigate that but it allows NOT to overload the html file and create screens, effects, divs, as one pleases, when needed in the script.
- how to work with MY OWN fonts and stop being dependent of googlefonts! also awesome!

**next:**
