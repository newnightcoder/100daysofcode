**what i did:**
- it was new year's night and i was working at the hotel (very quiet) so i decided to start js: my gift to myself!!!
- i youtubed "js introduction" and i chose [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk&t=1202s) by Programming with Mosh.
- i typed my first hello world in js and then played with alert :P
- of course i used scss for the styling sheet (no plain css anymore, it's over) but it is messy! :P 
i just noticed i used a completely useless @mixin for the body (what?) and i forgot to put some variables in some places etc...lol. 
i will review and correct.

**what i learned:**
- i started javascript!!!!! and it's a great language, i am so happy of it, it can theoretically  do really anything + it works so beautifully with html and css, super inspiring!

**next step:**
- i want to swim like a dolphin in js! 2020! let's go.
