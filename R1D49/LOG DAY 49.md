**LOG R1D49** (01/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1223478435642847232)

**what i did:**

- i tried to write the code as logically as possible to make life-- and gameOver work but no success.
- i reorganized the game states part of the code, as well as the resetBall/loseLife part. everything seems more logic now. 
- it was a good re-organising session/search and try = better overall understanding.


**what i learned:**

- i think i don't get my loseLife and gameOver functions to work because of the interactions there is between gameStates/displayMenu and some other functions:
i have to rationalize everything and just follow the path of logic. ALL the proper variables, functions and conditions are set/present in the code, so it is now just a matter of organising the logic and code for the right/logic connexion.
- i learned more about JS syntax (if statement without {} etc...).


**next:**

same as yesterday:
- life-- and gameover 
- access to other LEVELS.
