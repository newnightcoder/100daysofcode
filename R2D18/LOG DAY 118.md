**LOG R2D18** (30/04/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1255894246210633729)


**what i did:**

- i started to learn D3.js on freecodecamp!!! (the [datavisualization curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-with-d3/))
the idea to do this came from [Anders](https://twitter.com/abjorkland) on twitter! he started it and reported how good it was.

**what i learned**

- how awesome and handy D3 is!!!
- i learned about method chaining (reminds me of : fetch .then .then .catch !!! also a chain!)
- i was scared of the charts and was hesitating between charts.js and D3 (advice of [Jhey](https://twitter.com/jh3yy)!!!) and i understand now how exciting/open D3 is. more room to build/create than charts.js.
i feel much better/more confident towards the project now!!! i can do it.

**next:**

- create a first chart with the general data already available.
