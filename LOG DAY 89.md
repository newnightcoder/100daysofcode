**LOG R1D89** (12/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1237977975016108032)

**what i did:**

- i learned more about WHAT and HOW to do with the JSON DATA returned by the API.
- i still have to find out how to select the data from an ARRAY of data! (Amadeus hotel API sends back data as arrays!!! for my test, i have 2 arrays corresponding to 2 hotels...)

**what i learned:**

- i can "cut" the url into parts/VARIABLES! it is absolutely AMAZING!!! i'm happy/feel better.
- use variable(s) to "get" user input!! of course! = DOM manipulation involved!
- display the JSON data by selecting the element i want to display: data.element.underelement etc...
- i realize i'll have to work much more on the DESIGN of the app, add "pages" etc.. in order to display the data requested by the user!! cf hoteltonite.com

**next:**

- FIND OUT HOW TO *SELECT DATA* FROM AN **ARRAY OF DATA**!!! FUNDAMENTAL!!! NOW!!! 
- (if possible find another hotel API. try Travelgate / find the best free hotel API if it exists.)
- try and CODE! start with just hotel.name: display it!!! + PLAY with Paris and London! it should WORK!
- if it all works nicely, go full-on DESIGN again and go as "professional" as possible!!!
