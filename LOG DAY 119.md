**what i did:**

- i created the charts section of the dashboard + DOM elements with d3.
- i'm trying to create a dataset of confirmed numbers per date (for France) in order to make my first graph. 

**what i learned**

- how to start using d3 in my project : very easy/handy
- how to access the confirmed number for each date manually!! ['1/22/20'] : date as a string within []!!

**next:**

- create the dataset: find how to get each .confirmed for all dates.
