**what i did:**

- i finished the first chart!!! (tooltips, hover effect, axes, titles, data filtering etc...)
- i worked further on the general layout of the dashboard: good progress!!!


**what i learned**

- more D3: i feel more and more comfortable, BUT! very challenging!!!
- Object.keys, .values, .entries: **object to array** methods!!! this is what i've been looking!
- CSS entities!! perfect for pseudo-elements!!
- all countries dropdown menu! (select + option with value attribute)


**next:**

- connect graphs to dropdown menu!
- switch graphs (with transition) between countries using dropdown!
