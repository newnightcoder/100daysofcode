**LOG R1D5** (19/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1207507148919525376)

**what i did:**
- i coded to make the background images fit both in landscape and portrait view on my phone and it works only for portrait mode. on laptop the bg img is cropped.
- i played around with my code to see what works and what doesn't.


**what i learned:**
- use of % for images! duh :)
- also started the [4 hours video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srvUrASNj0s&t=1023s) about css reponsive design by freecodecamp and it's great, have to finish it.
- parallax effect on laptop (by accident lol - comment is on stylesheet) 

**next step:**
- finish the freecodecamp course and re-code everything clean from scratch.
