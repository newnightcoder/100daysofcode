**what i did:**
- i slept. i couldn't fight/resist because my body+brain could not take it anymore.

**what i learned:**
- sometimes i will need to sleep/shut down. i didn't want but i am not an android, i have human limits. so sad lol. but ok.
- before falling asleep i was learning a bit more for my game and i think i know what i have to get into: eventListeners!!!
in order to "take control" of what happens when the player will press the arrow keys!!!

**next step:**
- let's start to work with eventListeners (full syntax, each single detail etc...) - let's try
- sit down/read the JS ressources i printed on paper: SYNTAX, FUNCTIONS, LOOPS etc... 
- study JS
