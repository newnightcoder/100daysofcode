**LOG R3D10-11** (14/08/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1294115786836135937)


**what i did:**

- i could find and fix the issue i had with todo.task rendering: cool!
- implemented localStorage with useEffect hook!!! awesome/easy!
- i tried to implement the filter buttons with useState (but i'm not sure of which approach to take... even with the MDN explanation [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_filtering_conditional_rendering)) 
- i discovered useReducer, which makes sense for what i'm trying to do but it's more complicated... i have kind of a result sofar but it's not working well.

**what i learned:**

- useEffect hook : "side effect" of state change / seems easy to use
- useReducer hook : i have a better idea of how it works thanks to some nice [tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-state-usereducer-usestate-usecontext) + all the info online

**next:**

- find the missing part to implement FILTER FUNCTIONALITY (either with useState -try again! it's not that hard- or useReducer)
- general styling:
  - animations
  - scrollable div
  - darkmode
  
- ~DEBUG THE TODO RENDERING!!! it was working perfectly fine with class component + the code makes sense! so fix the problem.~  
- ~**finish rewriting the code as clean as possible: functional components (with react hook useState()) + CSS-in-JS**~
- ~now that everything is cleaner: implement LOCALSTORAGE!!!~ 
- ~continue with props + more refactoring to make **functional compononents**~
- ~refactor code to **create COMPONENTS**~
- ~check and delete functionalities of the todo app.~
- commit files or code to github via terminal.
