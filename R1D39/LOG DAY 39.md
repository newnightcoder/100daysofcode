**LOG R1D39** (22/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1219859485621202945)

**what i did:**

- i tried to use everything i could remember from yesterday's learning about arrays and for loops to code for the bricks for real.
i could get one row! but no gap visible and i still don't know how to make 3 rows.

**what i learned:**

- how a for loop works in the code (+ syntax ok!)
- at the end of tonight's session i realized that i should use the fact that elements in an array are defined by their INDEX! 
that's super useful/important. it's actually fundamental! the key is there. 


**next step:**
 
 - use the INDEX OF THE BRICKS in their dedicated array to create them! (not their x position, even if the idea was interesting but actually NO! the array is here to help! try!)
 - i should write/prepare the code for the bricks on paper first and breakdown each step. i will find the solution eventually. 
 - find out how to include the GAP defined in my singleBrick object..
 - make 3 rows of bricks. actually, make the logical "connection" between rows/columns/bricks and their array! again, plan on paper first! + don't be scared. use logic. be strong.
