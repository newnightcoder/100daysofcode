**LOG R2D20** (03/05/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1256787708346880001)


**what i did:**

- i managed to get the confirmed cases for each date of the french timeseries using my first for in loop!!!
- read/researched more about loops and how to create arrays (also: i spotted a syntax error in a code example in "A smarter way to learn JS" in the loops chapter! happy i could spot that lol!)
- tried the .push() method to get all the values in an array but it creates as many arrays as iterations in the loop...


**what i learned**

- for in loop!!! very handy to access object in an object (but is it really the best way? someone on stackoverflow said it's not that great... we'll see with more knowledge and experience)
- .push() method to add items to an array
- new Array() constructor to create an array


**next:**

- put all the values in an array and create the chart!!!
