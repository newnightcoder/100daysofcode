**LOG R1D61** (13/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1227808588032348162)

**what i did:**

- i followed Laszlo's steps/explanations to FIX the issue and have the levels display one after the other! and it's WORKING! (except for level1, i have to fix my own bug lol).
- i also tried to figure out how to use the debugger tool.

**what i learned:**

A WHOLE LOT thanks to this help experience!!!

- i could NOt have figured out brick.rows*brick.columns!!! it seems so simple and easy now that i know it, so OBVIOUS as i designed a TABLE but though it was in front of my very eyes my brain would not have "commuted" to that.
this solution helps me make progress logicwise! 
- pay attention to LOCALLY vs GLOBALLY declared VARIABLES!!! read about that and be able to re-explain. understand WHY/HOW.
- pay attention to === : like operators it is extremely urgent to master this NOW. learn and retain.
- the switch statement haha! : to USE!! i have to get used to it and get out of the "comfort" zone of if statements. though the "same" thing, switch statements
 are really cool. learn and incorporate to daily practice as much as possible. 
- CONSOLE.LOG!!! i have to get to it. USE IT. 
- DEBUGGER TOOL: how does it work?? RESEARCH/LEARN ASAP AND PLAY WITH IT ALL THE TIME. i WASN'T debugging until now, what was i thinking? time to grow up knowledgewise.
- my first PULL REQUEST hahaha! that's cool! i want/have to learn how that works for real, for the future.
- i will love dev collaborations. i can't wait to get better and know more and get to an interesting level!!! so exciting/inspiring!

HELP APPROACHES:

- this experience of explicitely asking for help to Laszlo and Nathan turns out to be absolutely PERFECT.
- A) Laszlo took the "(pro)dev-plumber" approach and IDENTIFIED + LOCATED + FIXED the issue in the context of my very code! without changing anything or almost to what i wrote.
this is amazing because i get to understand each step for myself. from each detailed explanation of Laszlo, i could code and fix it indeed (i know my code now and i could immediately UNDERSTAND!!)
- B) Nathan took the "(game)dev-masterclass" approach and sent me back a PERFECT code/LOGICAL STRUCTURE: absolute TEMPLATE / classy coding style i will have to get to eventually. i am going to learn tremendously from him, this is so generous and VALUABLE.
- combining these two absolutely different yet ideal approaches allows me to just boost my knowledge/energy/programming skills/overall coding confidence.

LEARNING BY DOING

- this whole experience/game project is indeed teaching me a lot. more than expected of course. 
+ i feel how it made me develop a sort of endurance, little strength. good thing.
- it was a good idea to ask for help, because the stuck phase wasn't being productive/inspiring anymore + i now feel relieved from the pressure of time and can move on to other/new topics like JS sound and text.
- i am still such a beginner, so to ask for help/guidance to Jedis can be both reassuring of course but also and mostly NECESSARY. do NOT try to solve everything alone as a newbie. learning happens also thanks to the EXPERIENCE of advanced developers.

**next:**

- sounds FINALLY!!!
- finish CSS/creative aspect
