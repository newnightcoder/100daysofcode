**LOG R1D4** (17/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1207170652584763393)

**what i did:**
- i discovered media quieries and it's really amazing!! i had some results with my code today. small results but still! :) 
though i think there must be other/better ways to make a page responsive, for the moment it's great to see my Prince tribute web page look so much better on a phone.

**what i learned:**
- media quieries

**next step:**
- continue further with grid and responsiveness according to the plan/timeline i did yesterday on iCalendar. 

*ps: to have a plan of learning, with a timeline, will help a lot!*
