**what i did:**

- saturday night: i discovered/jumped into learning Bootstrap/react-bootstrap + MDBreact (a material UI library based on bootstrap, material version, really nice)
it made me realize that i need to practive bootstrap much more! it allows a lot + it ties into my new vision/understanding of web development: BUILDING things, using the appropriate techs to do it!
awesome discovery, enjoyed the night a lot, but it took me time to figure out some things and i couldn't get into more React learning.

- sunday night: i chose a topic and wrote my 1st blog post!!! to just to push myself to start doing it for real and creating the habit, as i want to have it! to write at least every week.
it took the whole night and some hours, organising everything, cutting/adding/editing etc... i guess it took so long because it was my 1st post and i just jumped into it! from now on i know how it looks/feels like, so i can be more concise or pick a less general topic etc...
anyways: GREAT experience. i feel super happy!!! it's a mini achievement right there! lol

**what i learned:**

- how to install and deal with libraries / dependencies + material UI => to practice!
- how to write a post on dev.to!! love it!! i want to write as much as possible, it helps a lot for me to practice/deepen my JS understanding + it could help even 1 person, so that's perfect.
