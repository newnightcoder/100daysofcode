**LOG R1D2** (16/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1206422560214323202)

**what i did:**
- i remade my Prince tribute page using css grid!!! HUGE difference in final result. 

**what i learned:**
- the POWER of css grid! super excited to learn it further as i realize now all that it makes possible in terms of layout!
 
**next step:**
- css menu/navbar 
- learn more git and go slowly cause i did a fxxxing wrong git push a few minutes ago...
- still extremeley motivated! i love this challenge and all the benefits of following the process (learn git and github, get to learn from other devs, feeling of progress etc). it is actually more of a perfect learning method than a challenge.

*ps: i just did a git revert to cancel a wrong commit i did after writing this log a first time, earlier.
i don't know why but i decided to commit something through atom/terminal and it went really south lol.
i tried the revert commit command on github desktop and after several merge conflicts, manual fixing, error messages, tears and sweat, here is my repo as it used to be an hour ago! yuhu!*
