link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1307969369104961536)


**what i did:**

- i improved the design of my cards, implementing my own handmade material-ui inspired cards!!! cool!
- i finally managed to get the countries to display as a table with the flags. but the JSX ("html") structure of it is not that great.
at least, i know how to access the data i want, that's awesome! but i have to "re-construct" the table in a better or "cleaner" way lol!
but super happy it's finally working!!!!

**what i learned:**

- how to access my data properly with destrucuration (within the `map()`:
`data.map( ({country}) => <div>{country}</div> )` 
or
`data.map( ({countryInfo}) => <img src={countryInfo.flag)}/> )`    
- how to better write async await fetch function 
- practice of how to handle data and state!!! that's really cool! i do get it for real! it's really "easy" at the end of the day.

**next:**

- the SEARCH filter!! or SELECT ?
- interactivity with the list of countries!!
- ~countries component!!! list or table~
