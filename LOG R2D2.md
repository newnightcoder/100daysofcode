**LOG R2D2** (13/04/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1249597699478958080)


**what i did:**

- i tried to fetch() from another similar API with more documentation and it's working!
- i started to try to design the dashboard but i've been overwhelmed by all the data/display possibilities.
- i have to prepare a "map" or plan of what i want. which data goes where?  

**what i learned**

- more flexibility with APIs / rapidapi
- more about fetch() and request options (header etc...)

**next:**

- ~get the covid-19 data in the console = solve the fetch() issue / fix the header~ : *solved*
- design of my dashboard : *in progress*
- use proper ARRAY METHODS to display the data!!!
- display data on a chart.js graph / WORLDMAP??? START THINKING ABOUT THAT!!!
- let's conitnue to update/write for the blog - catch up.
