**LOG R1D11** (25/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1209673475469787137)

tonight was xmas eve, working at the hotel, didnt sleep during the 24th because i was so overexcited to play and code all day for my Tschichold layout and to also finally find out about CSS animations! 
i'm so tired right now! gotta sleep as soon as i get home in 2 hours :P

**what i did:**
- more Tschichold codepen with grid. some results in terms of responsiveness/flexibility 
(i can make the circle shrink dramatically in size when resizing the browser window vertically using vmin!!! 
but NOT horizontally yet..) 

**what i learned:**
- i now understand much more about flexibility/reponsivenes related issues and how far it can go with grid - thanks to Jen Simmons (her channel is truly amazing: [Layout Land](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7TizprGknbDalbHplROtag)) 
- i have so much more to learn about those units and their best use and css grid in general. it is easy with simple layout but it seems to get trickier now..

**next step:**
- same as yesterday: min and max sizing practice + keyframes (to animate the lines on Tschichold) 
- finish this pen and continue to train with grid on other designs by Tsch. They are just amazing.
