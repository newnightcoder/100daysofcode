**LOG R1D66** (18/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1229679446275317760)

**what i did:**

- i PSEUDO-CODED BEFORE IMPLEMENTING the 'winLevel' state in order to get a perfect transition between levels.
- i changed the design according to new decision.

**what i learned:**

- i could feel how i can now navigate more easily within the LOGIC and make the connection faster to understand and solve bugs. it's also due to the fact that i know my code very well of course.
- PSEUDO-CODING is amazing. it is INDEED the best way to get the PROGRAMMING LOGIC and ideas on paper, like a plan, BEFORE starting to actually code and implement.
- i have to pseudo-code every project. if it doesn't easily make sense on paper, then don't even bother starting with Atom. 100% useless. 

**next:**

CLEAR THE CHECKLIST TO FINISH THE GAME!!

- ~~implement GAME STATS~~
- ~~implement SPACEBAR for ALL BUTTONS!!! not only pause.~~
- ~~create winStates~~
- ~~RE-CREATE the overall DESIGN according to new decision.~~
- CREATE GAME RULES SCREEN 
- finish the ENDING.

and:

- FINALLY implement ball ANGLE
- fix minibug ball/paddle AND THAT'S A WRAP.
