**LOG R1D6** (20/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1207875105101103104)

**what i did:**
- i rewrote the whole code from scratch, trying to be as clean as possible.
- use of comments in the code in order to get used to that good practice. 
(my comments are "useless" for the moment, as they are redundant to the code, but it's at least a good thing to try not to code too messy and take the habit to document/comment, even for other beginners like me at this point in time!)   

**what i learned:**
- how to apply an overlay/filter on an image + solved my bg img problem sofar ;)
- more about media quieries

**next step:**
- i want to finish this layout for day 7.
