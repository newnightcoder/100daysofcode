**LOG R1D3** (17/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1206776577217966080)

**what i did:**
- i coded for my tribute page on codepen for over 2 hours last night and could't get any further results with css grid.

**what i learned:**
- 2 hours is nothing, i become addicted when i start! but that's a good sign. i have to make more time to code everyday.
- as a future developer, i learned that sometimes you code, try things out, read und let the code "talk" to you, but nothing valuable comes out in terms of new fonctionality or bug fixing.
but it forces you to look deeper on your own code and it has benefits, like giving you new ideas to try out, new concepts you definitely have to  master, and all your weaknesses, which is great.  
 
**next step:**
- continue to dive and swim in css grid ([wes bos grid course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-slCsOrLcc&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP5CIFvt9-ze3IngcdAc2xKG) + [bootstrap grid system doc](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/))

*ps: advice to read bootstrap grid system doc came from [Ashley](https://twitter.com/CrashleyGames) on twitter, who commented on my tweet of the day to encourage me. super nice, thank you!
Ashley did memory game in React, now a google book search app (project involving a database and React as the front framework)...*
