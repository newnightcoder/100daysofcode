**LOG R1D7** (21/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1208271118437666816)

**what i did:**
- i used css grid for real for the first time, and i got pretty nice results in terms of LAYOUT and responsiveness.
- delivered the layout for my Prince tribute page for day 7, it was super important for me.

**what i learned:**
- media queries aren't that much needed to make a site with images responsive! CSS GRID is amazing!!! 
- use of flexbox in the grid. it went well at some point until it didn't lol, so i used the float property instead and it worked!
- i have difficulties with nested grid and flexbox in a grid... 
- how useful SASS really is. have to use it for real now.

**next step:**
- rewrite the css of the page using SASS.
- align gifs with FLEXBOX and not float.
- add NAVigation to the page.
