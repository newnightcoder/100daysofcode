**LOG R3D04** (07/08/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1291614095045734401)


**what i did:**

- refactored my app.js further to create clean **functional components**!!!
- which made me practice a lot of destructuring + state management (props): i got super lost at some point, couldn't understand my own app anymore lol so i took a little break and my brain got clear again after that.
- the app is working nicely sofar! 
- but i didn't have time to start implementing localStorage...

**what i learned:**

- class components to handle state / functional components without state (work with props passed from the class component)
- a lot about functional components: props and destructured parametersðŸ˜Ž!!!
- React hook **useState** makes it possible to have all components functional!!! (useState() does the same work as setState in a class component)

 
**next:**

- now that everything is cleaner: implement LOCALSTORAGE!!!
- animations
- scrollable div
- darkmode
- ~continue with props + more refactoring to make **functional compononents**~
- ~refactor code to **create COMPONENTS**~
- ~check and delete functionalities of the todo app.~
- commit files or code to github via terminal.
