**LOG R2D63-67** (22/06/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1275127055269744642)


**what i did:**

- i implemented dark-mode + 50% of bg-img option.
- did some more styling (buttons/scrollbar) + options to develop later (weather/pomodoro/maybe calculator?)
- i finally managed to create the localStorage array of to-dos!!!


**what i learned**

- good revision of CSS tricks for the dark-mode (label for input/ input:checked + label .toggle etc..)
- localStotage property and methods (.setItem(), .getItem(), .clear(), .) + JSON.stringify (to save to localStorage) or JSON.parse (to get from localStorage).


**next:**

- finish implementing storage of the items: on screen persistence 
- implement select item : rewrite the code better
- fix refreshButton rotation onclick behaviour: in progress
- fix userWarning disappear animation onclick behaviour : in progress
- ~implement delete item~
