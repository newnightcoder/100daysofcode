**what i did:**

- i implemented the geolocation for the weather app!! had forgotten about it!!
- finally tried neumorphic styling for the weather app and it's quite working! (not sure it looks neumorphic but it looks good!)
- A LOT of learning.

**what i learned**

- **navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => console.log(position))** : AWESOME!!! (position as an object where coords are accessible!)
- so much more about how JS works under the hood 
  - Javascript Runtime Environment (JRE)
  - Lexical environment (LE)- Global environment (GE) - execution context - scope!
  - single threaded engine => callstack => event loop + callback queue
- it is all so important to understand how the code works + how to better debug/understand problems!!! have to lkeep learning and get more and more familiar with all those new notions.

**next:**

- pomodoro app
- pocket-calculator

TO POLISH:
- weather CSS: improve styling!! 
- implement select item : rewrite the code better
- fix refreshButton rotation onclick behaviour: in progress
- fix userWarning disappear animation onclick behaviour : in progress
- ~user geolocation~
- ~finish implementing DELETE from the localStorage array, almost there!~
- ~finish implementing storage of the items: on screen persistence~ 
- ~implement delete item~
