link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1228591308920565760)

**what i did:**

- i replied to all the messages i received from fellow code newbies! (also in order to keep my inbox afloat lol because there were so many messages!!)
- then i started coding and could immediately fix the level1 display bug that i created 2 days ago when implementing Laszlo's corrections to fix my level issue.
- i learned and coded (finally!!!) to implement the sounds FX when the ball hits the paddle, the bricks and the canvas borders + gameover FX + levelWon FX! it sounds COOL!!

**what i learned:**

DM ASSISTANCE

- it took me almost 3 hours (2h41) to answer to ALL messages, which i had NOT planned at all! but it's been SO illuminating/compelling and just awesome. also, some of them (the minority) were not newbies at all and super experienced technically, so great encounters for me as well!
- i have to reorganize my coding sessions according to the idea i had tonite (daily dedicated timeslot of max 2 hours to assist other newbies), in order to have SUFFICIENT QUALITY TIME to reply to everybody as perfectly as i can for each one WHILE! keeping the necessary time/hours for me to learn and code/progress = new feature to implement in my life. i find it super inspiring/fantastic. it was a good idea to start doing that now.
- it helps me A LOT too to "help" or rather share everything i know sofar with people who need it/want it!! + with some of them we just talk about becoming a dev/general dev matters... something great is happening in me intellectually speaking, i'll define/identify what it is at a later stage of this journey. 

CODE

- it's easy to add sound to a web page or a game and there are different ways to do it: 
"classic" DOM manipulation via html audio tag / CREATION of the audio tag via JS (amazing: document.createElement!!! what??? the "magic" of JS) / create it all in JS with: let *soundName* = new Audio() + *soundName*.src = 'path to audio file' + *soundName*.play(). and BOOM. it's working. very handy and easy.

**next:**

- implement GAME STATS!!! NOW. 
- deepen learning about new object creation etc...
