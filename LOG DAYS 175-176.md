**LOG R2D75-76** (02/07/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1278551640514146304)


**what i did:**

- started using/learning CLI/terminal!!!
- improved the weather app styling a bit / created loading page during fetch()!!! very cool!!!
- updated the clock!!! it's now 100% real/dynamic (i hadn't noticed/thought about the fact that it was the always same time on screen from window load until browser refresh!!! i finally noticed it and could fix it with a setInterval(() => {timefunction();}, 1000))!!! really cool.
- researched about BUTTONS and that was a bad idea / i have to switch back to a navbar (of course)
- which made me research SPAs and how to best do it!! not easy, but i could find a nice way on stackoverflow/jsfiddle!
- A LOT of learning : i started my first course ever!!! (Colt Steele'JS Bootcamp bought on Udemy + Will Sentance's JS hard parts :WOW!!!)


**what i learned**

A LOT!!!
- clearer on function execution context / memory storage / how functions work "under the hood" => helps understand JS code so much better!!!
- OOP for real (in JS)! i understand better what it is and how it works / gives me much more perspective on how i should rewrite my code
- object constructor, this keyword (2 different meanings object/function)
- functions can be objects!!! they are both function and object
- closure = "bagpack" of data when a function is stored in another function! (__proto__) = have to dive into this aspect of JS!
- SPAs and how they work (the big picture) => my all-in-one app is an SPA! (i want it to be!)

JS Basics:
- modulo % : i could write my very own mini algorithm to determine if a number is even or not lol!

Terminal + dependencies/json files:
- ls / cd / mkdir / rm / cd ..(to go up 1 level) : that's a good start!
- npm run eslint lol
- i understand how why/how to edit package.json file!! + node-modules folder!
