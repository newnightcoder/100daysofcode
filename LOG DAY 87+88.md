**LOG R1D88** (11/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1237635155487002624)

**what i did:**

DAY 87:
- i took day 87 off! unplanned but obviously necessary, breaks help knowledge/understanding sink in and relieve tensions.

DAY 88:
- i did make the GET request via Postman to receive hotel info from Paris and London and it worked.
- i could find how to go from Postman to the actual CODE and make the http requests with JS!!! i learned a lot through it!! + it's working, i received the JSON data in the console.
- i did further learning/reading about fetch(), working with APIs and Amadeus DOCS : i understand much more today. let's continue.

**what i learned:**

- how to switch from Postman to the CODE (very easy BUT i had corrections to make so it made me practice and understand: awesome! i'm happy! + it will be a good working code snippet to reuse!!)
- how to chose the data i receive from the API (parameters to chose)
- i will have to adjust/"scale down" the project to make it viable. using a travel API, the data received is limited + important to focus/go slowly, so i have to first make a hotel search app (Paris). let's see how that goes.
- Amadeus might NOT be the best hotel API actually, i find it very limited... let's dig further. else Travelgate or any other good one.
- [blondiebytes YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcLMSci1ZoPtXsxjCsVDoaxM04sAmQGIc) is helping me a lot! she is really great!

**next:**

- how to connect the app to the data? how should it work? = back to layout of the app to see HOW/WHERE to display the infos
