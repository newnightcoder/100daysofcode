**what i did:**

- i could FIX the score display BUG!!! (fillStyle BEFORE fillRect, omg lol)
- almost finished styling/css
- wrapping up now

**what i learned:**

- i knew it but fillStyle/fillRect !!!
- more Figma, to cut the tiles perfectly, so coooool!!! much better than automatic online spritesheet-cutter, no comparison.

**next:**

FINISH THE GAME!

- ~~fix SCORE display!~~
- fix resetBall() PERFECTLY (it's possible!! find out, apply step by step method)
- implement ball ANGLE.
