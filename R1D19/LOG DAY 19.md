**LOG R1D19** (02/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1212621969046331392)

**what i did:**
- after getting inspired by JS yesterday, i decided to code for a tribute version of the mythical Arkanoid game!
- i coded for the canvas + its style in html/CSS and then i drew on the canvas in JS!!

**what i learned:**
- A WHOLE LOT!!!! 
1- querySelector or getDocumentbyId (i know the difference thanks to someone on stackoverflow);

2- let, not var anymore (so also i learned about ES6 and all that!);

3- importance and beauty of the CONSOLE!!! so much help thanks to it!!!;

4- context, fillRect (x,y,w,h) and for an arc (x,y,radius, 2xMath.pi (WOW!!!!! so proud to know that haha! of course! a circle perimeter is = 2piR !!!) + boolean, because an arc can go clockwise/true or not/false);

5- the beginPath() thing! very important not to forget!!!

6- DO NOT SIZE THE CANVAS IN CSS BUT HTML!!!! THIS IS MINDBLOWING!! i got an ellipse during 1 hour while coding for a circle! so i searched the answer on the net and someone somewhere explained that!!!
i moved my sizing from css to the html and i got my perfect cute circle!!!!! WOW.

- other things related to syntax, JS in general etc...
- i begin to have a good method for finding the right information or questioning what i read/what people say. 
i can find solutions + when my code doesn't work i do not feel stressed and sad anymore (as opposed to when i started html and css, sometimes i wanted to almost cry because of temporary frustration lol).
i feel calm and okay now because i know the code is mine and i will find the answer anyway(even if it can take time, it is ok).

**next step:**
- MAKE THE PADDLE MOVE AND THE BALL AS WELL!!!!! FUNDAMENTAL!!! i will go crazy of joy when i do!!!!
 
 **feelings**
 - now that i am in JS, i really feel so comfortable with html and CSS!! i really can't believe it!! the difference is OBVIOUS.
 i manage to design what i want, how i want it, without any worries + quickly! 
 i try things, like having my canvas NOT taking the whole screen like in every video i see on youtube!
 it is nice to do my own thing on my own thanks to all the resources available out there! (tonight [this guy](https://twitter.com/christopher4lis) helped me so much!!! 
 thank you!!! <3 i love the dev community.)  
 - the game thing!!! i would never have thought about that! it was so far away from me and kind of a dream... 
 i thought it would be impossible for me and it's not!
 - i am so happy of this decision i took to start JS now! it even helps to get more fluent with html and css, they become soooo natural to declare! 
 - i have a better perspective of everything (html/css/js)
 - all i want for now is to swim and dance in PURE JS.
