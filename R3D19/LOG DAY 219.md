link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1304267020809236483)


**what i did:**

- i implemented a sort of hamburger menu! love the look + i really wanted to try it for a long time! awesome!
- i fixed the  conditionals for counter messages
- worked a lot with useState hook to implement, try and learn different things! awesome!!!


**what i learned:**

- how to make a hamburger menu (nice CSS tricks!) + i used of useState (eventhough in the example i saw, the person was using a class component with this.state).
Such a great exercise to implement it myself with useState!!! i'm happy! 
- how to use useState with boolean state : 
```
const [state, setState] = useState(false)

const toggle = () => {
  setState(state => !state)`
 }
```
- i learned the hard way that: **the TRUE or FALSE in useState IS NOT A STRING!!!** it took me hours to finally BINGO! all the rest of my code made totally sense!
