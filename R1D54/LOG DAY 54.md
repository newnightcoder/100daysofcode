**LOG R1D54** (06/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1225290352799748097)

**what i did:**

- i tried all the ways i could think of to get my boolean logic to work through a levelUp function. somehow frustrating!!!
- when i set the condition to true manually, it works! the next level gets displayed! why doesn't levelWon = ! bricks[r][c].unbroken or levelWon = levelWon && ! bricks[r][c].unbroken WORK???
- i am stuck but i'll find out. remember the paddle situation lol.

**what i learned:**

- though my boolean logic seems flawed in some way, i feel good about my code/coding. given the fact that i get the levels to display manually it means that the condition i wrote isn't that "wrong"..? and that my overall boolean logic for this matter isn't that far from correct..?
anyway i'll know once solution is found! 
- more experiment with JS! and i do love it! it is still so exciting!!! i even got the levels to show at some point! but again: too early, before all the bricks in the array were broken.. don't remember how i did that though, i was in the zone lol... which means there is something here that i do NOT UNDERSTAND!!!

**next:**

- sounds. maybe it would be good to get out of this level issue to do something else.
- at the same time i do not want to switch gears now. i want to FIX that LEVEL ISSUE because i am close! i will. let's go.
- sounds.
