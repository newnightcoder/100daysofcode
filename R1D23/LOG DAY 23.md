**what i did:**
- i coded for an eventListener to the canvas so that it moves the paddle i drew inside of it, when left or right arrowkey is pressed.
(i feel like it's better to have the paddle in js than as an htlm div... i hope i'm not mistaking! but it seems more logical really)
- it took me some hours to try different options, learn/better the syntax, use the console (such a brilliant help!!! cool!)
- no result at all regarding moving the paddle, but my code seems acceptable because the console is okay with it... so what's wrong???
- i tried good things/had good ideas, so that's a good start.

**what i learned:**
- eventListener, function (event), switch statement! 
- i am extremely messy with JS, too much code erasing and rewriting / totally all over the place! 
that's because i'm drowning in too many resources and that's not good!! or maybe it is but i have to ORGANISE myself/my thought process/FOCUS + step by step!
- i am still so impressed by JS, the syntax and the order, i don't know where (what line?) to put things, the function, the variables, the paddle itself (at the beginning? below everything? in the middle?)
 depending on where the portion of code is, it works or it doesn't...

**next step:**
- i have to find out the solution to make the eventListener WORK! i feel like i am so close!
+ it is the first 50% of the game! (other 50% : the ball...)
- i give myself 4 days to figure this out, one way or the other. i have to finish arkanoid within 10 days max.
it would be amazing! let's try.
