**LOG R1D86** (09/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1236912959282130945)

**what i did:**

- worked a little bit further on the technical blog (in order to clean/precise the plan / i did NOT do enough CODE etc... more in-depth next time!)
- i relaxed, watching videos and chilling!

**what i learned:**

- importance of archiving : i have to incorpoate the CODE as well + write about the experience itself.

**next:**

- API call
