link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1293051238779625472)


**what i did:**

- i commented out the whole code and started from scratch again. i want to organise the project/components the best way possible
- intro to css-in-js: i discovered styled components and emotion ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XgCyJ3XA7lzpaT7HN5fNY65RuqN_j6vaPrWbxq0Vjso/edit) to a great resource sent to me on twitter by Conner)


**what i learned:**

- how styled components work : have to try it now!!


**next:**

- **finish rewriting the code as clean as possible: functional components (with react hook useState()) + CSS-in-JS**
- add FILTER FUNCTIONALITIES!!!
- general styling:
  - animations
  - scrollable div
  - darkmode
- ~now that everything is cleaner: implement LOCALSTORAGE!!!~ 
- ~continue with props + more refactoring to make **functional compononents**~
- ~refactor code to **create COMPONENTS**~
- ~check and delete functionalities of the todo app.~
- commit files or code to github via terminal.
