**LOG R1D97** (20/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1240915011133980673)

**what i did:**

- i could ITERATE through the JSON array of data, using my first map() method ever!!! + join() in order to get simple strings.

**what i learned:**

- what an ITERATION is (through an array)
- map() method + join(): amazing!!!
- insertAdjacentHTML!!! even "better" than createElement()+appendChild!!! wow

**next:**

SAME AS YESTERDAY:
- display results with **insertAdjacentHTML**!!! + finish STYLING the results page.
- add image / hotel description if possible (Amadeus API seems to be too limited... look for a more exhaustive/comprehensive one.)
- handle writing input (paris/london)?
and
- LEARN ABOUT OTHER ARRAY METHODS!!! SO COOL!!!
