**LOG R3D13** (05/09/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1302118994766426118)


**what i did:**

- i did more re-styling of the to-do app : it really looks better!
- i implemented the clock with useState + useEffect!
- could find out how to code the proper conditional for the counter message!!! working nicely
- started working on the animations! some CSS is working just fine but i'll need to look into react-spring or retry CSS Transition (css animation is not working on the todos as i want! it works but it applies to the last item in the ul, not the first one dynamically added at the top! bummer!)
- i'm super close from finishing to implement the FILTER functionality (my mistake sofar: use of setState! i should rather use a "all" default state + filter)

**what i learned:**

- still an excellent React refresher/exercise + i feel much more comfortable! it's like all i've learned settled in during the last 2 weeks and i feel much more confident with React.
- react-spring for animations: i have to dive into it!
- material-ui library 

**next:**

- finish FILTER FUNCTIONALITY (either with useState, useReducer or back to class component)
- general styling:
  - animations: *in progress*
  - darkmode
  - ~scrollable div~

  
- ~DEBUG THE TODO RENDERING!!! it was working perfectly fine with class component + the code makes sense! so fix the problem.~  
- ~**finish rewriting the code as clean as possible: functional components (with react hook useState()) + CSS-in-JS**~
- ~now that everything is cleaner: implement LOCALSTORAGE!!!~ 
- ~continue with props + more refactoring to make **functional compononents**~
- ~refactor code to **create COMPONENTS**~
- ~check and delete functionalities of the todo app.~
- commit files or code to github via terminal.
