**LOG R1D55** (07/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1225638642313396227)

**what i did:**

- i tried to review my code to understand where the problem starts, and it's deeper than the boolean thing : it comes from the way i'm creating+drawing the bricks for each level.
i have to re-implement that correctly, there is a detail there that i am clearly missing. 
- i started [YDKJSY](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/get-started/README.md) by Kyle Simpson and that's AWESOME!!!  JS is FASCINATING!!! much more POWERFUL than i thought!! it gives me a lot of renewed energy to learn JS!!!

**what i learned:**

- i learned what DEBUGGING looks/feels like! it is extremely interesting because i am close from the goal and have to find the issue!! a sort of double learning! 
- i really think i have the sufficient knowledge at this point to fix my level issue. i trust/hope that i will figure it out based on logic and proper use/expression of JS.
- more about JS and programming in general!! (procedural / oop / functional paradigms/styles and JS can mix the THREE "simultaneously"!!)
 

**next:**

- debug!! find the solution/link between bricks display and levels! (+ it is extremely important to stay optimistic in order to make it work!)
- if ABSOLUTELY stuck, ask for help for real. it will help the learning anyway. but keep searching first, it's possible alone! remember the paddle situation :)
