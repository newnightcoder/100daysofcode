**LOG R1D65** (17/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1229291598518915072)

**what i did:**

- i implemented the game STATS!! (life, score and levels). adds A LOT!!! makes it all even more REAL. i'm happy.
- i started implementing spacebar for "everything" (except home screen because mouse needed there).
- i decided to change the overall design and let go of my "design statement" of the mini canvas. the game takes another dimension when played directly on Arkanoid's original tiles! F.CK! lol

**what i learned:**

- how to display text and images on the canvas! so handy and interesting, i should use it again + document.createElement (for winScreen)!!
- what i heard is true: as a "game dev" you would have to let go of some of your "personal preferences" in order to please the maximum players (don't be unflexible/stuck on your view and admit things/be able to adapt): though it was an interesting design statement, the mini canvas will have to go. it will BOOST the game SENSATION. i tried it myself and adopted it, so... let's move on. a bit sad but this is for the better. (or find another way to use the mini canvas! or let go of it, as decided. + isn't it the 2nd AGILE principle??? "WELCOME changing requirements, even LATE in development LOL. Agile processes harness change for the better.." so let's go!)

**next:**

CLEAR THE CHECKLIST TO FINISH THE GAME!!

- ~~implement GAME STATS~~
- ~~implement SPACEBAR for ALL BUTTONS!!! not only pause.~~
- create winScreens
- RE-CREATE the overall DESIGN according to new decision.
- CREATE GAME RULES SCREEN 
- finish the ENDING.

and:

- FINALLY implement ball ANGLE
- fix minibug ball/paddle AND THAT'S A WRAP.
