link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1234046124580835329) 

**what i did:**

- i finally found project 2!! "Hotel Now" or something like that: based on booking.com for the dynamic/hoteltonight.com for the design/layout/spirit.
- i started the design, it's extremely fun and exciting!! 
- i found some APIs on rapidapi indeed!!!

**what i learned:**

- i understand the API concept more and more, i could find mine, dive into it. to continue tonight.
- i practiced an all flexbox design lol (to go faster and in a mobile-first approach) : works perfectly.
- it went very well!! (cf [Ellie](https://twitter.com/ellie_html)'s influence to do it as perfect/professional as possible!)

**next:**

- make it fully responsive/perfect = mobile first.
- call the API?? lol. yes.
- i don't know, we'll see, just want it to work like a pro app (as much as possible)
- Notion Notion Notion!!!
