**LOG R1D43** (26/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1221313648020410368)

**what i did:**

- first of all i totally REARRANGED my code before starting anything, and it looks so much more engaging and enticing! so exciting/excited to work on it. i can clearly see its structure (MY structure!) and navigate through it happily.
the idea/need/urge to REORGANISE came from the anxiety of yesterday needing to be silenced for good, and THAT was the solution from the get go! i am so happy now.
so i did exactly like i would do on paper if it was an essay or a doc. i would ORGANIZE the hell out of it, i am good at sorting/organizing/make things clear.
so why didn't i do that earlier? this skill is FUNDAMENTAL FOR CODING. major progress with my code.
- i finally used the INDEXES of the bricks!!! by CREATING bricks[r][c] thanks to the nested for loops!!! until now, i was indeed drawing a nice table, but just coloring its cells!!! that made me understand nested for loops and that's very good. but to ACCESS the BRICKS AS INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS, i had to reference them/each of them thanks to bricks[r][c].
= the first loop gives me access to bricks[r] - the rows! and the nested for loop enables bricks[r][c] of course.
- i coded for the 'pause' state, implementing the spacebar key of the keyboard: when pressed, game is paused. and that works!! i did that in a few minutes or less, at the end of tonight's session, just like that!

= i start to really figure out the PROGRAMMING logic.
- i coded for the ball to collide with the bricks and it works beautifully! except for this little bug (same one as with the paddle). i will have to fix it before release of the game (+ ball glitch).

= the nested for loops were ALSO NEEDED in ballBricksCollisions()!! in order to give me access to bricks[r][c], and from there no problem.

**what i learned:**

- part of the anxiety wave i felt yesterday came from the fact that my code was f...ing MESSY. so stressful and uncomfortable to work on. not enticing at all. just a 100%-anxiety place.
- i feel SO MUCH BETTER today/tonight. codewise, projectwise!!! it's perfect.
- the indexes were indeed the missing piece that tormented me and that's good that i listened to myself. i could finally understand and just make it happen.

- again: things take their own time/have their own pace to sink in in me. i do NOT control that at all. if i really apply this principle to the next difficulty i will encounter along the way, fear should be eradicated because pointless.

**next:**

- fix the 'pause' issue + find out how to implement life-- and 'gameover'.
- play with CSS+JS to make 'start' + 'pause' + 'gameover' pages EXIST. do that and the game will not be far from done!!!
- start learning/coding for the scoreboard + sounds. that's exciting!
