**LOG R2D30-32** (17/05/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1261912923305316352)


**what i did:**

- i improved some CSS of the overall design, it looks better.
- i had to rethink the whole section 1, and i have to start with a worldwide chart. then go to each country.
- i've been stuck/unproductive because i don't really know/haven't started to reorganize the data in order for my structure to work.
i can see how it works but i don't know how to make it happen.
since i twitted today, i feel better. things aren't indeed as linear and perfect as i'd like but they progress. i WANT/NEED to finish this project! and learn all there is to learn along the way.
so i have to refocus, deconstruct and follow the logic. as i did when doing the game.


**what i learned**

- more easiness with grid, units, template literals and array methods.
- i just learned about reduce() and that opens a whole new thing / might bring me back to loops as well.. i need to feel more comfortable with for loops and loops in general. it's easy at the end of the day. really easy.
- to be overwhelmed can happen. i thought it was over but it can still happen. the thing is to keep track of what i want, breathe and restart.

**next:**

SAME

- connect graphs to dropdown menu!
- switch graphs (with transition) between countries using dropdown!
