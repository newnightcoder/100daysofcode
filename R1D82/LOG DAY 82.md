**LOG R1D82** (05/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1235445881047937024)

**what i did:**

- i tried to get my access token but could not get any further.
- i installed/tried the Access-Control-Allow-Origin chrome plugin. no success.
- i "tried" my first .catch statement and it's working! but well...
- i can now read the request in dev tools (Network --> token : great!!! that's an actual progress) / could see code 200(!) but no response and 400(bad request)

**what i learned:**

- more about CORS and http request
- ERROR HANDLING thanks to .catch: i see the potential (nice error message to the user!!! awesome!!! i understand)
- devtools Network
- PROMISE!!! i finally know what it is!!! after all this time seeing articles and resources about it! comforting to be there already, but frustration not to be already playing with the API /json data...
- basic ASYNC AWAIT concept!!!
- i feel tired/overwhelmed. return of the "what if i stay stuck there forever?" feeling. (need to let it sink in + PATIENCE needed. it will come.)

**next:**

same thing as yesterday:

- fix the ERROR 400 to get the token and make the API CALL.
- NOTION: update technical blog + archiving until up to date!
