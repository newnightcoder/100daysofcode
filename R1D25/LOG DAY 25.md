**LOG R1D25** (08/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1214783758123098112)

**what i did:**
- at first i tried to code for the proper function in order to have the paddle move when arrowjeys are pressed.
- it didn't work/something was missing, so i researched and could easily find the appropriate material (MDN ressources mainly)! 

**what i learned:**
- many things about creating a game:

1- it needs animation! i completely forgot to requestAnimationFrame! :)

2- also a game is a loop, this creates the perpetual loop/movement ball/paddle

3- and the logic of my eventListener was GOOD but incomplete, my move functions also.

4- the eventListener/jey inputs have to be handled by a function (eventHandler or inputHandler)

= THERE IS A METHOD TO MAKE A GAME!!! WOW!!!

- the questions i was asking myself yesterday about the game loop, constructor, time delta etc... were right! 
but i do NOT have to wait to learn it, it should happen now! it will give me a good JS start.
- to make a game is less easy as it seemed to me in the beginning and i jumped into it without knowing, so naively! 
but that's great to learn all that, i feel so happy/fulfilled!
- (Nick Ang)[https://twitter.com/nickang] said that to make a game is a really good way of learning/jumping into JS 
and i only now do i realize how much he was right! it goes much deeper than i thought! 
it brings me to get to know and understand MUCH MORE than just move left or right..

**next step:**

- start the creation of the game following the traditional/good practice (basic)game dev method.
i will discover where that brings me...
