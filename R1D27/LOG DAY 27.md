**LOG R1D27** (10/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1215511338975485952)

**what i did:**

- i could not really code or focus (hotel fully booked and too much to do all night).
- towards the end i had a nice interaction with [JavaScript Teacher](https://twitter.com/js_tut) and it triggered some good thinking! (eventhough i still cannot figure out what he meant exactly... but i was stimulated by him and i think it helped!).

**what i learned:**

- nothing definitive, i am still searching.

**next step:**

- try the idea of directions/pression on keys as "variables"/booleans to include in a move function, which should be invoked in the eventListener...
