**LOG R2D94** (25/07/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1286850699704315905)


**what i did:**

- surprisingly i struggled a bit with the dark mode (some elements would not work as expected until i found solutions CSS+JS)
- i finally managed to fix the issue when the user doesn't allow geolocation for the weather app!!! it's all working nicely now!!!
- i did in fact **refactor** a lot of code for the weather app and it feels/looks better now i think!! at least, it's working "logically".

**what i learned**

- i now understand better and better how to use functions / cut things in smaller parts (i knew the theory but i feel like i practice it better now!!)
- refresh for darkmode implementation (used what i did for the covid dashboard and adapted it better)
- more about the geolocation API!!!! really awesome!!! getCurrentPosition() method can take 2 parameters!! not only "position", but also "error" (error being part of the navigator.geolocation object!!! awesome)


**next:**

- calculator?
- welcome screen for pomodoro + calculator
