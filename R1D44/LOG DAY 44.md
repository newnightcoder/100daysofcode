link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1221668803739820034)

**what i did:**

- i played with html/CSS to design the game menus (position absolute? flexbox? many interesting/exciting questions! i'm trying to design the simplest version of what i have in mind)
- i started setting up the functions to access both html and css (querySelector method of course + functions to trigger the manipulation depending on game state.)
- this was the beginning but i am satisfied. i want to let sink in for now. back again tonight.

**what i learned:**

- i've finally started learning about basic DOM manipulation! (window + document elements)
- this game project is really multi-dimensional in terms of what it teaches me/makes me learn! i do not regret, it's amazing!!! i feel more and more confident doing it, now that the main hurdles are behind. it's been tough sometimes and will probably continue to be for some aspects but i feel much more comfortable with JS everyday. 

**next:**

- finish all the html/CSS now + finish the gamestate logic in JS.
- manipulate the elements as desired!
- finish the logic for life--, game over and pause.
