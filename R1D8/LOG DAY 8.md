**LOG R1D8** (21/12/19)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1208611647545368577)

**what i did:**
- 100% Jan Tschichold inspired css grid layout, thanks to this AMAZING [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxrsO4aIjyc) 
by [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons)!! wow.
- i want to finish it within 4 days - perfect exercise to practice and boost html/css skills and overall layout creativity.

**what i learned:**
- today was a lot of fundamental css: properties "transform" and "writing style", and pseudo elements. i am happy. 
- more about grid layout.
- flexbox still needed, i have to get to it asap. grid + flexbox work together nicely for sure. i
already knew it from my Prince tribute project, but I NEED TO LEARN AND USE FLEXBOX.

**feelings at start week 2:**
- i really learned a lot within 7 days and got to know some very interesting people from everywhere around the world.
- i feel comfortable now with html and basic css, i play around a lot and try things and still get frustrated sometimes, 
but i find the (or a) solution faster than a few days ago. 
- there is more method in my thinking.
- i really love to code, it's so great, but time flies so quickly while doing it, 2 hours seem like 5 minutes! 
that's because i am still a beginner i think.
- i have to get more precise in every detail and master every little thing i code for. practice more.
- i have to definitely solve this "position" property issue i have. i sort of "feel" it but it's not fully controlled. 
i'm still a bit "scared" of it, don't know why, it's so easy to understand though! practice/read more.
- 100% motivated - i think it will continue like this, at least until i get to JS in January :P
- this 100 days of code thing is fantastic because you have to organise yourself to make time for learning/reading/watching good tutorials and courses/let them sink in and apply what you learn by CODING EVERYDAY + commit to the world. 
it's actually like a PERSONAL BOOTCAMP! i feel like i've found a treasure lol. 
- i have to keep same energy but also rest more, seriously :) 
- it feels impossible to burn out at this point because the joy i have from learning/coding and navigating in the dev community fulfills me + perspective of working there one day - soon... 
- this life change i wanted to happen seems to take place nicely, gradually.
