**what i did:**
- 100% Jan Tschichold inspired css grid layout, thanks to this AMAZING [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxrsO4aIjyc) 
by [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons)!! wow.
- 

**what i learned:**
- today was a lot of fundamental css! properties: transform and writing style, and pseudo elements. i am happy. 
- more about grid layout.
- flexbox still needed, have to get to it right after grid. both work together nicely for sure. i
already knew it from my Prince tribute project, but I NEED TO LEARN AND USE FLEXBOX.

**feelings at start week 2:**
- i really learned a lot.
- i feel comfortable now with html and basic css, i play around a lot and try things and still get frustrated sometimes, 
but i find the (or a) solution faster.
- i really love to code, it's so great, but time flies so quickly while doing it, 2hours seem like 5 minutes! that's because i am still a beginner i think.
i have to get quicker and better. more precise and master every little thing i code for. practice more.
- i have to solve this positioning issue i have. i sort of "feel" it but it's not fully controlled. practice more.
