**LOG R1D76** (28/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1233270035537416192) 

**what i did:**

- many things happened! / i want many things! / very rich!!! :

- 1) there was the question of Lorna tonight on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60437233/how-do-i-restart-my-timer-and-refresh-my-vital-stats-without-refreshing-the-wind), about her virtual pet timer + restart button!! it reminded me of my own issue with my set Timout and restart button haha!! so i decided to try to help and see if it rings a bell for me!!
i opened her code in Atom and could understand everything, her writing is nice, synthetic, awesome experience!
Laszlo has already solved the problem haha!! which is also very inspiring and just amazing, as always: excellent developer/brain. (on top of human quality).
i want to reach his level / i learn so much thanks to him and his attitude! + this great dev environment i'm in right now!!! (remember the loneliness you were in before the challenge and how you wanted to connect with like-minded people but did NOT know how to do or where to go and were a little bit sad. just wow!! exponential daily boost + fantastic encounters/friendships)
- 2) i think i should really start with API's (while consolidating everything is learnt so far: syntax, basic, still!!! be more rigorous.. it's all too loose... cf qualities of Lorna's code. learn/consolidate/re-take time to read)
- 3) API project: Ashley sent me the key!! [RapidApi](https://rapidapi.com/): this is exactly HOW i'll find my project!! so MUCH is possible!! extremely excited about this!! i want to start now! but i have to choose first. idea is coming.
- 4) i discovered that [Cyris](https://twitter.com/sudo_overflow) is doing robotics/IoT + 3d printing etc... mindblown. (we connected the same day as JS_tut's tweet and he is great!!! he often tweets very interesting things but i did NOT know that about him) - cf Joe Karlsson and his expose on IoT with JS.
the **continuum** thing is happening again and my brain is getting over-stimulated right now, i am beyond happy. this is being extremely strong, i'm extatic!! i chose the right path. brilliance.


**what i want:**

- i want to start project n.2 !!! i want the idea, working with an API.
- i want to try an IoT project!!! : i want to make the led blink with js/nodejs. cf round 2 at some point, yes.
- i want to start learning hexel + phaser for real!! cf Lemmings. 
- (sleep/restart gym!!! and then perfect happiness lol)
- organize time: all of the above is possible but order and timeline NECESSARY. (restart gym might help! push.)

**next**

- start project 2 (channel current energy overflow)
- should rest for real. excitement yes, exhaustion NO. 
- catch up on the learning. Notion app asap. so much to put in it...it will be great once done.
