**what i did:**
- i paused my js learning because i had to completely remake the layout of the game using CSS grid and NOT absolute positioning! wtf???
- i coded for a nice grid, using chrome dev tools (great help to see and understand my grid)


**what i learned:**
- NEVER EVER USE absolute positioning to create a layout.
- ALWAYS USE CSS GRID when creating a new layout! no matter what! this journey is supposed to lead me to FRONTEND development!
it will also be the best and only way to MASTER CSS GRID for good + each new layout will/has to push me to deepen my knowledge of grid.
- i need to be less impressed/scared by CSS grid: i could actually implement the grid super quickly (it's only CSS, relax) 
and also PLAY with its sizing + chrome dev tools, to finally get it! great feeling of understanding CSS grid better and better! 


**next step:**
- back to JS and make the paddle move using the ARROWS of the keyboard!!! 
i don't know if i can actually do that at this early stage of my JS process, but i have to find out asap!!! 
if i don't push myself, there will be no game to play in the first place! and that's not possible.
