**what i did:**

- i could finally animate the SVG marker using the animate attribute!!! really cool!!!
i'll have to make it more precise, perfect pulse etc...
- didn't need the path of the SVG, i just wrote the xml code and it's working nicely!!
- reformatting of the footer with moment.js : perfect + very easy!
- i fixed the buttons so that they are colored when section is clicked
- restyling of the labels on the map, it looks better!


**what i learned**

- easiness/handiness of moment.js!!
