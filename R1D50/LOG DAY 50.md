**LOG R1D50** (02/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1223847900012253184)

**what i did:**

- i had a nice rest/slept and recovered a lot (body+brain).
- i could finally code for life-- and gameover!! everything is working smoothly in that regard now. i feel super happy and relaxed to start the last part of the game.

**what i learned:**

- it is important to THINK and ACT like a dev! [Laszlo](https://twitter.com/LaszloWa) inspired me lot by fixing his Hangman game so quickly in such a pro/responsible manner.
i have to do the same: find what/where the issue is and FIX it. it requires to MASTER my own code, which wasn't perfectly the case until now: i was still a bit scared to touch again my game states part! (which should not happen again because remember the code is YOURS. quite amazing!) 
- codewise: the SYNTAX!!! what was i doing with the if statements??? WTF??? i have to STOP guessing and just learn. learning by doing is good but just truly learn this kind of fundamentals and apply. the goal is to LEARN JS, not create it.
- my logic was good, the variables and functions set properly, i just had to trust myself and create this f***ing gameover STATE!! i was missing that part + it was wrong to avoid touching the gamestate part. wtf? 

**next:**

- create level 2 and level 3.
- introduce sounds and music!

**feelings at day 50!**

- so this is exactly half of the journey now! i feel super happy and committed, it is all so natural and evident now. i'm becoming a coder/future developer!
- love learning JS, i want to MASTER it and have the maximum "knowledge+fun" with it.
- i start to be really certain that i will enter the dev world/start my new life/career one day! if i keep up, it will be possible. this is still the beginning so let's keep climbing. we are now on the mountain anyway! i am literally climbing it!
- i am not so sure i will be swimming like a dolphin in JS at day 100. but replying this morning to [Pauline](https://twitter.com/paulinelucrezia)'s tweet made me think that this "challenge" will set me/prepare me for a good ROUND 2! 
- i'll get closer to the dolphins during/after round 2! for now i am learning how to swim in JS/programmimng waters and i LOVE it, so let's keep up and continue working, it's being AWESOME/SO INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING!!!/FANTASTIC.
- i would NEVER have imagined i could get "this far" at the beginning (basic html/css lol). JS seemed so unreachable, yet i wanted to learn it but was very impressed. it's getting much better now: i want to learn/know/practice everything!!!
- parallel growing passion/interest for GAME DEV!... wow...
- i really do think this "challenge" is not a challenge per se but just the BEST goal achievement method to do something important for oneself. CODING TO BECOME A GOOD FRONT DEV.
- PERSONAL BOOTCAMP INDEED. or maybe just: long-lasting life transformation. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.
