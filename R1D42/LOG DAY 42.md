**LOG R1D42** (25/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1220937547767042049)

**what i did:**

-  i coded for the "start' state of the game using a setGameState function which takes the parameter state so that my new variable gameState gets updated accordingly.
let gameState; //'menu' , 'start', 'play', 'gameover' etc...
setGameState(state){
gameState = state
}
setGameState('start'); and boom!
- now the game is on 'pause' state until i decide to 'start' it! that's awesome. so much better!!
- i finished a first css draft of the game welcome/home page.
- i tried to create the ball-brick collision but was unsuccessful unfortunately.

**what i learned:**

- more about game states! (SO FUNDAMENTAL because it increases my understanding of PROGRAMMING in general + a game logic of course! i had no idea until i desperately needed to make the game loop STOP!, hence the progress)
- i realised i still have so much to do... i got a bit overwhelmed by what seems to be a sea a details... i cannot afford to be scared or too impressed, i have to jts focus and try. though i'm a bit scared, i don't know why... i hope i will manage to finish this game...
- i love coding, it's been over 40 days now and that makes so much sense to do it! i get more and more CERTAIN of my life change decision. this energy and continuous mindblowing learning makes me happy.
- i think the stress/fear comes from the unknown. it's my 1st project so i want to both code it perfectly+lern everything relared to it perfectly+deliver it asap. well, i have to calm down. it will be delivered whrn it will be delivered, it has nothing to do with anything. it is a REAL learning by doing experience+project, so the fear i natural. the most important while striving for perfection (though it shouldn't be energy-draining) is to just DO IT.
- today is a mix of joy/anxiety, which i like because it means i take it to heart. but i would like to become genius overnight and get over with it lol. 
- i have to calm down and relax. i am making progress. to be scared is normal because i am human. i can be quite good but i am just a super newbie learner so calm down. just learn and code. all of this is just awesome. do not be scared. the BEAUTIFUL end of the game will come. 
- the benefits of coding for this game from an html/css newbie level is pbviously the best that could happen to me to learn JS. yes it was naive to decide to do that, but it was for the best. keep up the good work and energy. the game is almost ready as a matter of fact. do not be scared.

**next step:**
 
 - USE BRICKS INDEXES to create ball-bricks collision. it will get better from there for sure. relax.
 - finish the game states. it's possible, very close. 
 - finish coding for life -- + game over, almost there. push yourself more. finish it. it's okay it's not perfect from the get go. just try and you'll see. to be impressed in not productive. be strong and TRY.
 - finish css game over (that's a pleasure so do it/find time)
 - ERASE + REWRITE EVERYTHING from scratch ASAP.
