**LOG R1D42** (25/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1220937547767042049)

**what i did:**

-  i coded for the "start' state of the game using a setGameState function which takes the parameter state so that my new variable gameState gets updated accordingly.

let gameState; //'menu' , 'start', 'play', 'gameover' etc...

setGameState(state){

gameState = state

}

setGameState('start'); // and boom! it works
- now the game is on 'pause' state until i decide to 'start' it! that's awesome. so much better!!
- i finished a first css draft of the game welcome/home page.
- i tried to create the ball-brick collision but was unsuccessful unfortunately.

**what i learned:**

- more about game states! (SO FUNDAMENTAL because it increases my understanding of PROGRAMMING in general + a game logic of course! i had no idea until i desperately needed to make the game loop STOP!, hence the progress)
- i realised i still have so much to do... i got a bit overwhelmed by what seems to be a sea of details... i cannot afford to be scared or too impressed right now.
i have to focus and try. though i'm a bit scared, i don't know why... i hope i will manage to finish this game...
- i love coding, it's been 3 weeks now since i've started learning JS/doing arkanoid mini, and that makes so much sense to code! the feeling and intellectual triggering it creates is just fantastic. this energy and continuous mindblowing learning makes me happy and will keep me going. the determination is real though a bit scared right now.
- i think the stress/fear comes from the unknown. it's my 1st project ever so i want to code it as perfectly as possible + learn everything related to it perfectly + deliver the game asap. 
i have to calm down. it will be delivered when it will be delivered, it has nothing to do with anything. it is a REAL learning by doing experience + project, so the fear is natural. the most important while striving for perfection (though it should NOT be energy-draining) is to just DO IT. 
- today is a mix of joy/anxiety, which i like because it means i take it to heart. but i would prefer to become a JS genius overnight and code for 10 projects until march lol. i am making progress so i just have to relax. to be scared is normal because i am human. just learn and code. 
+ all of this is just awesome! do not be scared + continue push and try. JS has been super welcoming since the beginning, so keep on learning. the BEAUTIFUL end of the game will come soon + there will always be an other sea of details somewhere on some other future project. get used to it from now on. see it as part of the job. and swim in it. it's enjoyable when you think about it. you dig for details and you find them, so enjoy and just code.
- the benefits of coding for this game from an html/css beginner level is obviously the best that could happen to me in order to learn JS. 
- to decide to start learning/portfolio with this game was for the better. keep up the good work and energy. the game is almost ready as a matter of fact. do not be scared.

**next step:**
 
 - USE BRICKS INDEXES to create ball-bricks collision. it will get better from there for sure. relax.
 - finish the game states. it's possible, very close. 
 - finish coding for life -- + game over, almost there. push yourself more. finish it. it's okay if it's not perfect from the get go. just try and you'll see. to be impressed in not productive. be strong and TRY.
 - finish css game over (that's a pleasure so find/make time to do it)
 - start manipulating the html/css elements in JS (start menu and gameover)
