**LOG R1D77** (29/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1233629604625178624) 

**what i did:**

- i browsed RapidApi and Programmableweb and that was great but too overwhelming, too much choice
- i browsed YT to find what's ahead codewise to do this project! and that's very interesting! possible. rigor involved.
- i re-started to learn JS from the start like at the beginning (i really love [Steve Griffith](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjkYdv4VjuIbvcMZVWSdOm58) and this playlist a lot.)
- i followed the energy of [Mark Manson](https://markmanson.net/do-something/amp)'s article "Do something" (thanks to Sean!) and just started to set up the files for the project! didn't want to stop then! of course lol but too late for tonight.
- still waiting for the inspiration/exciting idea to come - still searching/looking/discovering (i do not feel attracted to coding for a weather app. i would like something similar but more resonating with me: news? twitter? github? algo? hotels? galleries? trips? conferences???? so much choice, i don't know. and then: to do what? what do i find exciting? what do i want to do? i dont know, i'm waiting for the inspiration while learning.)

**what i learned or have to learn:**

i start to connect the dots and understand where this API project will take me:

- HTTP requests + JSON (amazing that i'm here!! it was on my original calendar, from december 2019 and i thought i WOULDN'T get to it! and in fact i am!)
- JS objects, i'll be able to consolidate that aspect.
- the return statement!!! + go deeper with functions.
- possibly DOM manipulation via innerHTML (ok! cf game.)

**next**

- overcome current "fear". it will pass by doing it for real. it will be extremely fun!
- continue mapping/planning learning to come + learn.
- choose and design the app! that's the fun/easy/creative part! + just jump into something. github is cool! or something with medium or twitter! 
- Notion app becomes urgent. to get now and catch up on ALL the learning/resources/old likes etc... GO!
