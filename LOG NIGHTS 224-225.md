**LOG R3D24-25** (17/09/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1306493413097975808)


**what i did:**

- i took a little break, i was a bit tired physically!
- fixed the footer of the game for mobiles (media query long overdue!ðŸ˜‰ )
- started to fix the layout for the todo-app because it was reported to me by several people (on twitter) that it's not looking right on their device (iphone and or safari browser!)

**what i learned:**

-sofar, that tehre were problems in my grid layout! (position fixed + grid-row:1 isn't possible! wtf was i thinking???)
i'll have to design the layout first, and then implement the functironalities, for the next project!

**next:**
  
- fix all the flaws in the todo app layout
- start layout for covid dashboard!
