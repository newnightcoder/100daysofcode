**LOG R2D21** (04/05/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1257283170015346694)


**what i did:**

- i tried with no success different ways to: 

1- get the numbers in a unique array which would then be the dataset for d3! 

2- get d3 to use the numbers 


**what i learned**

- maybe the for in loop is the root of the problem: when using the push() method to get the numbers in dataset, it works! BUT i creates as many arrays as iterations BECAUSE OF the for in loop in think..
- i need to find an alternative.


**next:**

SAME AS YESTERDAY:

- put all the values in an array and create the chart!!!

OR

-find another way.
