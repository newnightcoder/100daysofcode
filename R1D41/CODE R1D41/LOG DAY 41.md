**LOG R1D41** (24/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1220577052564377600)

**what i did:**

A LOT!

- i coded for the bricks using nested for loops, thinking of a table, and it worked nicely.
- i finally managed to set up the reset function for when the paddle fails to catch the ball, reset WITH DELAY!!! yay!!!
- i started to prepare the Menu page of the game = sort of welcome/home page for the hole game (which required some HTML and CSS and it feels so good to need them again for this project!! i thought it was over with css for the moment and it's not!!!)

**what i learned:**

- now i know how to use a for loop and nested for loop!!
- setTimout() function: perfect.
- how to manipulate some HTML/CSS with JS!!! + how CSS tricks (hidden visibility) interact nicely with JS sofar.
- how to design a WHOLE game over all, from the welcome/menu page to the game over.
- confindence and happiness with html and scss, really cool! + flexbox and more grid! just great. 
- more and more confidence with JS, i just "dare" things and they work most of the time!!! and when not it's more because of syntax (thank you Console!) than anything else: my logic skills improve little by little. it is a good thing.

**next step:**
 
 - solve the ball-bricks collision problem NOW.
 - do 2 or 3 more LEVELS! their design will be FUN to make. find out how to make that happen now!!!
 - finish styling menu/welcome page + game over page
 - implement life-- + message (find out how/understand!!! it's urgent.)
 - start thinking about the SOUNDS.
 - do not forget to ERASE + REWRITE EVERYTHING from scratch ASAP. it's a good thing to go forward but do not FORGET this fundamental exercize to get better at coding.
