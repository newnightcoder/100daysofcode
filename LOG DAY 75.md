**LOG R1D75** (27/02/20)

link to my daily tweets [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1232924336622837760) 

**what i did:**

- i relaxed! just modified a bit the speed of the ball (pushing the code via github desktop, like yesterday, perfect.)
- connected with new people on twitter, very nice!
- youtube a lot (Brad Traversy is great yes.)

**what i learned:**

- Brad Traversy's super HONEST [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=askbjJx-BQg) about remembering everything was great. very comforting/true. (to combine with the fact that i WANT/NEED to become JS-fluent!! so memorize the max: yes! BUT keep on focusing on the fundamental programming LOGIC. then python or c# would be possible?! i want!!!!)


**next**

- decide/find definitive idea for new project! then let's start with a layout and learn about APIs.
