**LOG R1D56** (08/02/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1226047327342862337)

**what i did:**

- i played further with my code to find where the link between bricks display and the general articulation of the game is.
- i'm still investigating... everything is linked in this "bug": bricks create+draw / pause state / levelUp().

**what i learned:**

- i should absolutely resort to a paper plan again! i should have done that from the beginning/earlier: PSEUDO CODING!!! i heared of it in a Andy Sterkowitz video!!! he's right.
- to lay down the "coding" plan/logic is/must be extremely helpful. i'll try this to get clarity/a better overview of my programming/code.


**next:**

same as yesterday! 
- find the solution/link between bricks display and levels! 
- if ABSOLUTELY stuck, ask for help.
