**what i did:**

- i managed to finish the landing page for my COVID IMPACT dashboard!!! it is now [online](https://newnightcoder.github.io/covid-impact/)! (laptop and mobile versions).


**what i learned**

- it has taken me some time to fully get back to css and feel 100% comfirtable. though i had ideas in the beginning, it's been quite a ride to implement them all.
- and now that the page is done, i don't understand what was so complicated to do!! lol it seems/feels so simple!!
- i love everything CSS makes possible and i'll have to make some time to practice CSS deeper on the side (even css+js)! i need more of that!!
- this landing page has been a very good basic CSS exercize for me right now.


**next:**

- back to JS and the dataviz dashboard!!!
