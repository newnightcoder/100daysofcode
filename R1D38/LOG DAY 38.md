**LOG R1D38** (21/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1219499005144633345)

**what i did:**

- i rewrote the whole code using only OBJECTS (paddle and ball) and it looks/feels so much better. this is an improvement of my code.
- i finally learned about arrays (and array methods to sort them/use them) and for loops. i understand what they are and what they do.

**what i learned:**

- proper syntax for arrays and for loops (i will have to practice for loops a lot)
- now i do know what an index is! it all makes sense now!
- i feel more comfortable with JS everyday and it brings new ideas and need for additional knowledge! that's a great feeling.
- i do not feel scared by the immensity of the JS ocean anymore. it actually makes me happy to know it's so deep and there will be so much more to discover. and i will become good at it one day.


**next step:**
 
- create the bricks + how can i make them different colors in the same array? find out because we cannot have same color bricks, not fun at all.
- i start to really want to have separate js files for each feature of the game. clearer/more "pro"/easier to rework on, even for later!!! try it ASAP just to see if it works as expected.
- intensify learning/do MORE READING.
- erase and rewrite everything from scratch again! asap = after the bricks.
- i feel the super strong call of CSS again and i want to learn a CSS framework so bad now!!! + experiment with the cool CSS tricks i found! + try to create my REAL landing page... = boost yourself + finish the game!!!
