**LOG R1D84** (07/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1236213747460472833)

**what i did:**

- i finally did a successful POST request to Amadeus API and received my access token. could not believe it (shook!), awesome.
- i did my first call to the Hotel API and the server responded error 503 (service unavailable) - i'll try again tonight!


**what i learned:**

- after spending the night quite lost/really disheartened/exhausted, it struck me in the morning that I SHOULD DEFINITELY READ the documentations better.
Thanks to Ashley who sent me some of her code + the MDN fetch resource (same one Laszlo had sent earlier), Jon who told me about his Paypal dev support email and Brian who sent the Postman DOC = i finally realized/understood that there is a  common pattern here!!! : the answer is in some form of research. there is NO simple UNIQUE process like for setting up a washing machine.
- extremely valuable experience again: to ask for HELP opens new perspectives/shows how other developers are working/solving problems!
- it's fundamental to LEARN how to navigate through DOCs + more trust in DOCs is needed. they look scary but in fact NO. super HELPFUL if not brilliant way to learn as well! new approach to implement NOW. this situation will happen again, maybe quite often! so i have to be able to navigate through DOCs and try!
- POSTMAN: absolutely perfect. i love postman! really great application!!  i'll use it extensively! (but fetch() has be back in the game asap! - it'll be needed to display the data etc... for sure)
- now i know how to make a token request! i could even try with TravelgateX at this point! and compare with Amadeus which one i prefer according to the data they allow me to play with! i want the more extensive catalog/Paris at least so i can verify if it's true!! cannot wait.

**next:**

- API call! If Amadeus server isn't back on track, try Travelgate! same process: focus, no fear anymore.

- NOTION: write about the whole API access token experience! / Postman / http verbs-requests GET and POST - UPDATE ASAP!
