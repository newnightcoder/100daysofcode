**LOG R1D96** (19/03/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1240567010649571329)

**what i did:**

- i broke the API url into parts to make the city a dynamic variable the user will be able to change! (preparatory work)
- i could code for calling the API when the NOW button is clicked. i did it without difficulties, using addEventListener + fetch(). it's step 1 of the process!! very happy.
- i created the "results" page to display the results of user's search.
- i could remember many things and code logically, very good/enjoyable session, mixing JS, HTML + CSS.

**what i learned:**

- i watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UoUqnjUC2c&t=856s) (API Query with User Input) by coding train and it made the whole process so clear, eventhough not for the same project + using P5! great!!!
- i am able to code on my own using everything i've learnt sofar.
- given the kind of data i want to get from the arrays/display on the results page, i feel like i might need to use an ARRAY METHOD SOON!!! 

**next:**

- handle input (paris/london)
- finish styling the results page
- add image / hotel description if possible = Amadeus API as is (free subscription) will be too limited for sure. look for a more exhaustive/comprehensive one.
