**LOG R1D48** (31/01/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1223111868664836103)

**what i did:**

- i coded for the startButton + pause state with spacebar (in and out) and it works!! so all menus are now connected/fluid.
- i did the CSS for gameOver state + still searching for this life-- condition + gameOver. 
- a lot of CSS for fun! + game overall design

**what i learned:**

- how simple it was in reality to implement the full pause menu: the simplest way was the easiest for me (if/else + setGameState(state)).
IMPORTANCE of the setGamestate(state) function / better than booleans...
- i am more and more comfortable wit DOM manipulation/events + JS in general.

**next:**

- LIFE-- / GAMEOVER !!
- access to other LEVELS.
