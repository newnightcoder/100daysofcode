**LOG R2D68-69** (24/06/20)

link to my daily tweet [here](https://twitter.com/Nightcoder2/status/1275886851677716480)


**what i did:**

- i finally could fully implement the storage functionality so that items on the list are persistent after browser refresh ON SCREEN as well!!
- i wrote my own displayTodos function, and it's working smoothly! (inspired by help/advice from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19635077/adding-objects-to-array-in-localstorage))
- started implementing the other 50% of the DELETE function (items disappear onscreen but not removed from the localStorage array yet... working on it!! i have some ideas)


**what i learned**

- the DOMContentLoaded event (in eventListener): so awesome, i had no idea!! and it all makes so much sense now of course lol. thanks to [Dev Ed](https://twitter.com/developedbyed)'s example!
- i feel better and better with JSON.parse() and .stringify()
- also getting to know more and feel better with devtools 


**next:**

URGENT:
- finish implementing DELETE from the localStorage array, almost there!

TO POLISH:
- implement select item : rewrite the code better
- fix refreshButton rotation onclick behaviour: in progress
- fix userWarning disappear animation onclick behaviour : in progress
- ~finish implementing storage of the items: on screen persistence~ 
- ~implement delete item~
