**what i did:**

- i finished to code + style the intro screen! i feel like the game is almost ready at this point.
- i fixed the buttons.
- still going now

**what i learned:**

- design requires quite some time as well!  at least as much as coding/programming. (it's a totally different timing)
- i'm so happy to get to enjoy the creative part now! i am wrapping up the project and that's a very exciting feeling! actually i can't believe it, it feels unreal. i'm happy!

**next:**
